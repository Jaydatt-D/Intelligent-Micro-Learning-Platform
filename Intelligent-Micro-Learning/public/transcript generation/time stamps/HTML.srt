00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Hi, everyone. Kevin here. Today, we're going to learn the basics of HTML or what stands for

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,600
hypertext markup language. I know that may not mean very much right now, but the thing to keep

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,760
in mind is that it's the basic building block of the web. When you type in a website address,

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,200
like let's say kevincookiecompany.com, the web server sends back an HTML file to your web browser,

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,440
say Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, that tells your browser how to display the content on the

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,640
page. In this video, we're going to build a very simple HTML page, and you're welcome to follow

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,800
along. We'll go through this step by step, and the great thing is you don't have to install anything.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,600
You already have all the tools that you need. We'll start with the basic HTML structure,

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,440
what elements you have available. We're not going to touch CSS or cascading style sheets,

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,280
which defines the look and feel of the page. We're also not going to touch on JavaScript,

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
which allows you to make a website more interactive. We're just looking at the

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,920
essentials of HTML. So if you're ready to learn about HTML, let's check this out.

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,400
Here I am on my desktop, and we are going to create an HTML website directly on your computer.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
I happen to be running Windows, but this will work on any operating system.

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,200
On my desktop, I'll right click, and let's go down to new. At the very top of this menu,

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,440
let's click on folder, and this places a new folder on my desktop. I'll title it Kevin

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,400
Cookie Company website, and feel free to do the same if you would like to follow along.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,480
Then let's click into this folder. This opens up file explorer. At the very top,

19
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,600
let's click on view, and then go all the way to the bottom to show. Within this menu,

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,600
we see the option for file name extensions. Make sure that there's a check mark next to this,

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,280
and you'll see why in just a moment. Let's now click out of this menu. Let's now right click,

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,720
and within this menu, let's go to new, and then let's select text document. This now places a new

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,720
text document in the Kevin Cookie Company website, and because we turned on file name extensions,

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,200
you'll see that the extension is .txt. Now, we want to create an HTML file, so let's select

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,520
all of this, and in place of this text, let's type in index.html. Look at that. We're creating

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,200
our very first HTML file. Let's now click away, and when we click away, we get a dialogue telling us

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,720
that we're changing the file name extension, and that the file might become unusable. That sounds

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,840
scary, but we know why we're changing it to .html, so let's click on yes, and as soon as we do that,

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,920
you'll now notice a logo appears next to the file name. This simply means that Windows knows what

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
application is associated with this file. Microsoft Edge is my default browser, which is

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,080
why we see the Edge logo here, but you might see the Google Chrome logo if that's your default

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,320
browser. Let's now click on this file, and this opens up Microsoft Edge, or maybe it opens up

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,480
Google Chrome, and look at that. We've now opened our very first HTML file, but you'll notice that

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,360
there's nothing in this file. It's completely blank, and that makes sense because we haven't

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,800
yet added anything to that HTML file. Let's now close out this browser window. Back in

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:40,000
File Explorer, I now want to edit my HTML file, so I've opened up an application called Notepad.

37
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,520
It's a really simple application, and you don't have to install it. It comes pre-installed on

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,480
Windows PCs. Especially for creating a very basic HTML website, Notepad will work just fine.

39
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,760
To edit this file index.html in Notepad, simply press and hold on this file, and then drag and

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,480
drop it into Notepad. Up at the top, we'll see that it's opened up a new tab for index.html.

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll click onto the Untitled tab, and let me close out of that. Here, we just have this one file

42
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:19,440
open. Down below, I can type in some text. Let's type in Kevin Cookie Company, and then I'll press

43
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,440
Ctrl S, and that saves the file. Back over here, let's click on index.html, and that opens up

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,840
Microsoft Edge. Look at that. We've now included some content into our HTML file. Nice work so far.

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,240
Let's close back out of Edge. Back within File Explorer, I want to be able to edit my website

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,280
side by side with my browser window, so I can see all of the different changes that I'm making.

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll snap this window over to the left-hand side. Next, I'll click into File Explorer,

48
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,560
and let's open up this index.html file again in the browser. Let's snap this over to the

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,240
right-hand side. Now, I have my Notepad opened up side by side with my web browser. This way,

50
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,760
I can see all of the changes that I'm making. I now want to add some additional text to my

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,040
HTML file. I'll press Enter on my keyboard, and here, I'll paste in some additional text.

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,240
You can pull this text from the kevincookiecompany.com website if you simply want to copy

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,560
and paste it into your index.html file. I'll press Ctrl S in Notepad. That saves the file.

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,200
Then, I'll click into the browser window. A really easy way to refresh the view is simply

55
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,120
press the F5 key, and that'll refresh it. Here, I see all that text within the browser window.

56
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,720
If you look closely at the text in the web browser, it doesn't quite match up with what

57
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,240
we see in the HTML file. I'll zoom in a little bit here. I say the Kevin Cookie Company. This

58
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,200
is my title. Then, I have a new line where it jumps to deliciousness in every bite.

59
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,960
If we look over at the HTML file, here, it says Kevin Cookie Company, and it just runs into that

60
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:04,160
next sentence. Why is that? Well, HTML is what's called a declarative language. We need to declare

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,880
what things are. I need to tell it, hey, this is a title, or this is a header, this is a paragraph,

62
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,720
or maybe this is a list. I need to tell the computer the meaning of the different content

63
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,080
that I have in my file. To do that, we're going to use something called elements and also tags.

64
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,400
Let's now insert our very first tag. I want Kevin Cookie Company to be the header of this

65
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,320
entire page. To insert a tag, we're going to enter in the less than symbol, followed by H, H for

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,400
header. Then, I'll enter in a one. This is the biggest header. Then, I'll enter in the greater

67
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,000
than symbol. There's my very first tag. I could save my file, and over on the right-hand side,

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,960
I'll press F5 to refresh. Whoa, look at that. It turned everything into a header. I don't want

69
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,640
that. If we look up at the top, you'll see that I opened the tag with H1, but I also need to close

70
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:12,000
the tag at the very end. Here, again, I'll type in H1. To close a tag, we need to enter a forward

71
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,920
slash before H1. This lets the browser know that we are closing this tag at this point.

72
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,440
This whole section together, the opening tag, the text, and then the closing tag,

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,560
this is referred to as an element. An HTML page is made up of many different elements.

74
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,120
I'll press Ctrl S to save my file. Over on the right-hand side, let's press F5. Look at that.

75
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,880
The Kevin Cookie Company is now the header, and all the other text is smaller than the header.

76
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,880
That's exactly what I wanted. Over on the left-hand side for the header, you can choose

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,880
header one, which I currently have set, all the way down to header six. Here, I'll change it to

78
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,840
a six, save the page, and let's refresh it over on the right-hand side. Here, you see that it's

79
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,960
a lot smaller. I actually want this to be the title of my page, so header one is the most

80
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,440
appropriate for this. I also want deliciousness in every byte to also be a header. Here, I'll

81
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,440
lower that text down, and let's insert another header. Here, I'll enter in the less than sign,

82
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,000
H, but this time, I'll enter in two. The reason why is Kevin Cookie Company is the main title.

83
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,640
This is a subheader, so I don't want it to be on the same level as my title, which is why I'll

84
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,640
use two here. Just like we did in this element up on top, we need to close it. Here, I'll enter in

85
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,760
the closing tag. I'll type in H2, and then the greater than sign, and here, I have my second

86
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,480
header. I'll save this page, and over on the right-hand side, let's refresh it. Look at that.

87
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,960
Here, I have my title, and then here, I have my subheader. As you insert different headers

88
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,280
into your HTML file, don't think of how it looks. Instead, choose the header based on the meaning

89
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,640
that you want to convey. Later on, you can use something called CSS to change the look

90
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,600
and the feel, but for now, we're just concerned about the meaning of the different items within

91
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,760
your HTML page. Within my HTML file, I have all of this text down here at the bottom,

92
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,640
but I don't declare to the web browser what this is, and this is a paragraph of text,

93
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,720
so I want to insert a paragraph element. Right up here, let's enter in the less than sign,

94
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,120
and here, I'll type in a P, and then I'll enter in the greater than sign.

95
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,920
You'll see that with these different tags, you can use uppercase letters or lowercase letters.

96
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,120
They are case insensitive, so here, I'll enter in the lowercase letter. You'll typically find

97
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,680
that they're entered in lowercase, but you really don't have to worry. I'll copy this tag,

98
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,160
and right down here, I want to close it. I'll move that text down, and here, let's close out

99
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,520
this paragraph, and right here, I'll enter in another paragraph for baking is our passion,

100
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,320
and we take it very seriously, and here, I'll also close it out. On this page now,

101
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,120
we have four different elements. This is one element. We have the second. Here's our third

102
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,560
element, and then we also have a fourth element. I'll save the file, and over on the right-hand

103
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
side, let's press F5 to refresh, and here, you see that I have a paragraph, and then down here,

104
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,840
I have another paragraph. Now, because I declared these as separate paragraphs,

105
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,120
here it inserts spacing between these different paragraphs. Within this block of text,

106
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,880
you see that I say every cookie made at the Kevin Cookie Company is crafted with only the finest

107
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,960
ingredients, and I really want to emphasize the text every. We can insert an element within

108
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:50,000
another element or basically a nested element. Over on the left-hand side in our HTML file,

109
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,560
here, I say every, and I'm going to open a tag and close a tag, and let's use EM for emphasis,

110
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:04,640
and after every, here, I'll close it out and type in EM. So here, I have one element within another

111
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,240
element. Let's now save this file, and over on the right-hand side, I'll press F5, and look at that.

112
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,840
It's now italicized the word every. Over on the left-hand side, instead of emphasizing this word,

113
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,880
I can also use another element called italics. I'll change this to an I, and here,

114
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,160
I'll change this to an I, and then I'll save the file, and back over on the right-hand side,

115
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,520
I'll press the F5 key, and it doesn't look like there's any difference. Here, it still shows

116
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:42,160
every cookie made in italics. Here's every in italics. Visually, they look exactly the same.

117
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:52,160
So does it matter whether you use I or EM for emphasis? It does. When you use a screen reader,

118
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,800
it'll read the words differently. When you use EM, it'll apply extra emphasis to the word every.

119
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,360
However, if I just use I, that only affects the visual appearance, and a screen reader wouldn't

120
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,960
treat it any differently. So the element that you use is very important. So although they may look

121
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,520
the same visually, keep in mind that screen readers may treat them differently. Back over

122
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:22,080
on the left-hand side, you can also bold a word. Here, I'll change the I to a B, save the file,

123
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:29,360
and let's refresh, and here we see every in bold. I can also change this to strong. I'll copy this

124
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,160
text, and let's place it in for the closing tag, save the page, and here, I'll refresh,

125
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,600
and here again, just like with emphasis and I, you'll notice that the visual treatment's

126
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,880
exactly the same, but this word for screen readers now carries additional weight.

127
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,440
Back over on the left-hand side, I can also underline words. Instead of strong,

128
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,880
I'll enter in a U, and here I'll change that to a U, and over on the right-hand side, let's refresh,

129
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,040
and here we see that the word is underlined. There are many different elements that you can use to

130
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,640
affect the visual appearance, and also the semantic meaning of the word. As we've been

131
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:14,160
working through this, you're probably realizing that HTML is not a programming language. Instead,

132
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,320
it's what's referred to as a markup language. That is, after all, why it's called hypertext

133
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,720
markup language. As we're going through this HTML file, we're marking up or declaring what

134
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,440
all of these different elements are. Here's the header. Here's another header, but not quite as

135
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,680
important as the main title. Here's a paragraph, and here's another paragraph. We're helping tell

136
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,560
the browser what every single element is within this HTML file. Along with entering in individual

137
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,200
elements, you can also tell the browser what elements go together. For instance, here I have

138
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,800
deliciousness in every bite with all of this text, and this all belongs together. I want to

139
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,680
tell the browser that. Right up above, I'll insert some new lines. Here, I'll declare this as a

140
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,680
section. I also need to close it out. I'll enter the end tag at the bottom. Here, I'll enter

141
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,320
section, and let me put in a forward slash. It's a little hard to read or to know that all of these

142
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,080
other elements go within the section elements. To make all of your different HTML more readable,

143
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,680
I also recommend using indentation. Here, I'll indent this out, indent out my paragraph,

144
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,760
and also indent out this paragraph. Notepad isn't quite the best. Here, you see the text wrapping,

145
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,120
so it's a little hard to tell that all of this is within section. We could go up to view,

146
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,640
and here's the option to turn off word wrap. When I select this, here it's very easy to tell that

147
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,920
all of this content goes within this section and that all of this content is related.

148
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,600
Next, I want to enter another section into my HTML file. Here, I'll insert a new line,

149
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,280
and here I'll enter in a new section. Just like I did in the first section, here I used an H2,

150
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,880
I'll use another header too with chocolate chip cookie recipe. I want to make sure to include that

151
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,600
on this homepage. Within the chocolate chip cookie recipe, I also have two additional headers, but

152
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,920
they're one level down from the recipe. Here, I have the ingredients, and then I also have the

153
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,880
baking instructions. I'll press control S to save the file, and over on the right-hand side,

154
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,000
let's press the F5 key to see how it looks. Look at that. Now, we just need to fill in the

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,360
ingredients. Now that I have these additional headers on my page, I now want to fill in the

156
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,440
ingredients. You can get the ingredient list from the kevincookiecompany.com website under recipes.

157
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,200
Over on the left-hand side, I'll insert a new line, and here I'll paste in all of the

158
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:54,320
ingredients required for our delicious chocolate chip cookies. Now, the order of the ingredients

159
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,640
doesn't so much matter. Here, I'll save the file and let's refresh. Right now, it's just one long

160
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,120
list of all these ingredients, but I would like to show them in a bulleted list. So to include

161
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,800
a bulleted or unordered list, we're going to use another element. Here, I'm going to open it and

162
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,960
we're going to enter UL, and this stands for unordered list. Now, just like we've been doing

163
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,080
all along, we also need to close it out. Here at the very bottom, I'll enter in the closing tag

164
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,920
and type in UL, and that closes it out. But I also need to specify or let the browser know where each

165
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,360
list item is or an LI. So here, we're going to nest another element within the unordered list.

166
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,840
Here, I'll open and close. We'll enter LI for list item, and here at the very end, I'll close it out,

167
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,200
and there, that should also close the list item. I'll go through and do that for the rest of the

168
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,120
items here. I've now added all of my different list items, and I also indented all the different

169
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,320
items, so I know that these are all part of this list. Again, it just makes your code a little bit

170
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,760
more readable. I'll now save the file, and over on the right-hand side, let's press F5, and here,

171
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,240
I can now see an unordered list of all the different ingredients required to make our cookies.

172
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,840
Down below, I also want to include a list for all the different baking instructions.

173
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,640
I copied a list of all of the baking instructions from the kevincookiecompany.com website,

174
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,040
and back over on the left-hand side, I'll insert a new line. I could insert a whole bunch of new

175
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,040
lines, and I'll paste in all of the baking instructions. Now, I want this to be a list as

176
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:39,040
well, but the order of all of these steps very much matters, unlike with the ingredients.

177
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,520
Instead of using an unordered list, we want to use an ordered list, and you guessed it,

178
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,120
the element name for an ordered list is OL. At the very top, I'll make sure to open it,

179
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,560
and at the very bottom, I'll close it out. Here too, just like we did with this unordered list,

180
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,960
we need to add list items for every single step in the instructions. Here, let's open it up. I'll

181
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,640
add a list item, and at the very end, I'll also close it out. Here too, I'll go through and do

182
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,120
it for every single item and also apply indentation. Look at that, we now have an

183
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,840
ordered list for all the baking instructions. I'll press Ctrl S to save the file, and over on the

184
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,480
right-hand side, let's press F5 to refresh. Look at that, we now have an ordered list.

185
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,680
What's the difference between an ordered list and an unordered list? Well, here you'll notice that

186
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,600
we just have bullets for each one of these items, and down below, we have a numbered list. Again,

187
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,440
this implies that the order matters. Remember, when we enter these different elements into the

188
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,120
HTML, we're trying to make the right choice to convey the right meaning for the content

189
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,040
that's contained within. Over on the right-hand side, in number four and number five,

190
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,160
I have two sentences in each of these, but just to make sure it really stands out,

191
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,400
I want to place each of these sentences onto a separate line.

192
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,720
Here, I'll zoom out just a little bit, and here I see where that second sentence starts. Here's mix

193
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,680
on low speed, here's mix on low speed, and then I also say stir and here's stir. To insert another

194
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,680
line, if I just press Enter on my keyboard, that won't make any difference to what's shown within

195
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:26,400
my browser. We need to tell the browser that I want a new line there, and there's an element

196
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,400
that we can use called the break. I'll enter in a BR. That'll tell the browser that it should

197
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,720
insert a new line, and here too, I'll also insert a break. Now, with the break element, you don't

198
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,360
have to close it. That's because all you need to say is break, and the browser knows exactly what

199
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,160
it needs to do. You don't need to wrap it around the sentence. Let's now press Save, and over on

200
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,320
the right-hand side, let's refresh, and here I see that second sentence is on another line,

201
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,640
and here that second sentence is also on another line. I think that makes it a little bit more

202
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,680
readable. The page is coming together very nicely, but over on the left-hand side, I want to make

203
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,880
sure that if any web developer comes in to this page in the future, that they understand that

204
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,280
this isn't just any ordinary chocolate chip cookie recipe. This is our best-selling cookie recipe,

205
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,400
so I want to add what's called a comment, just to add a little bit of extra clarity to this

206
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,520
HTML page. Right underneath this header, I'll type in a comment that says,

207
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,600
this is the Kevin Cookie Company best-selling recipe. I used a less than sign, an exclamation

208
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,320
mark, and two hyphens, and then two hyphens at the end, and the greater than symbol to let the

209
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,520
browser know that this is a comment, and it shouldn't display it to a visitor coming to this

210
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,480
page. I'll save the page, and over on the right-hand side, let's press F5, and you'll

211
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,400
notice that that comment doesn't show up at all. It's only embedded into this HTML file,

212
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,320
so only if you come in to edit the file can you actually see it. Now, one fun little trick over

213
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,440
here on the HTML page in my browser, you can right-click, and there's the option at the very

214
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,120
bottom to view the page source. You could also press control together with you, and when you view

215
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,320
the page source, here you can see all the different HTML that makes up this page, and look

216
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,560
at that. Here's that comment highlighted in green, so it's not visible on the page, but it's very

217
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,880
much contained within the HTML file. I'll close out of the source. All in all, this page looks

218
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,080
pretty solid, but on second thought, I don't know if it makes sense to include the chocolate chip

219
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,680
cookie recipe directly on the home page or the index page. It probably makes sense to have a

220
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,480
separate page that we link to from this home page. Over on the left-hand side, let's select this

221
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,440
entire section with the chocolate chip cookie recipe. I'll highlight all of that and then press

222
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,160
control X on my keyboard. That cuts all that content and places it onto my clipboard. Next,

223
00:21:54,160 --> 00:22:00,640
let's open up file explorer again. Back within file explorer, I want to create another page that

224
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,840
contains the recipe. I'll right-click with my mouse and let's go down to new, and here,

225
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,720
let's select text document just like we did with the index page. Here, I'll highlight all of this

226
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,040
text and let's type in recipe.html and then hit enter. Here, we get that warning again. Let's

227
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,480
click on yes, and look at that. We now have a recipe page. Just like we did before with the

228
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,400
index page, let's now drag and drop this file into notepad. Now, we have the index file opened up

229
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,640
side by side with the recipe. Let's now arrange notepad so it's side by side with the web browser

230
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,040
window. Here, I now have my recipe.html file and I'll paste in all of the content that contains the

231
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,680
chocolate chip cookie recipe. I'll save this file and I'll also save the index file. Over here,

232
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:55,840
let's refresh the index page, but one problem is how do I get from this index page to my recipe

233
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,320
page? Well, to do that, we can use what's called a link. To insert a link over on the left-hand

234
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,600
side on my index page, I'll insert a new line and type in some text that says, learned how to make

235
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,120
our chocolate chip cookies. If I save it and refresh, we see that line of text, but it's not

236
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:20,160
yet a link. There's an element that we can use to turn this into a link and it's called the anchor

237
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:27,440
element. Here, I'll open it and let's type in an A for anchor and I'll copy this tag, paste it at

238
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,720
the end and let's close it out. But still, that doesn't yet tell the browser where to send the

239
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,640
person. So we need to insert what's called an attribute. It basically tells the anchor

240
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,560
where to send someone and we're going to use an attribute called href or what stands for

241
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,280
hypertext reference. It basically tells the browser where we should send someone and I want

242
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:57,920
the person to go to recipe.html. Here, I'll type in recipe.html and then I'll save it. Now, over on

243
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,120
the right-hand side, let's refresh and look at that and there we have that link underlined and

244
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,480
you see that my cursor changes when I hover over it. When I click on it, look at that, that brings

245
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,320
us directly to our recipe page. Now, to go back, I could also click on this back button or we could

246
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,400
also include a backlink directly on the recipe page. Let's do that. Right up on top, let's click

247
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,320
into recipe. Back on the recipe page, at the very top, I'll insert a new line and let me paste in a

248
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:33,600
link. Here, I'm using that anchor element again and we're referring to the index.html page and

249
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,280
here I'm referring to it as home. I'll save this page, let's refresh it over on the right and now

250
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,000
I have a link that goes back home. So I could click on home, I'm back on the home and I can

251
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,040
click back and forth between my different pages. This way, you can help people navigate throughout

252
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,840
your website. The website really has some fantastic and valuable content but what would

253
00:24:53,840 --> 00:25:00,320
bring it to that next level is if we included some imagery. Up on top, I have another tab open for

254
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,120
the Kevin Cookie Company and here we have this beautiful logo that I would like to incorporate

255
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,880
into the website. I'll right click on this logo and then save image as. Feel free to do the same.

256
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,480
This opens up my file picker and I'll place it in the Kevin Cookie Company website folder.

257
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,760
Down below, click on save. Back within my index.html file, I want to include the image here.

258
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,000
I'll insert a new line and I want to place it right above my header. There's an element called

259
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,480
IMG which stands for image that allows us to insert an image onto the page.

260
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:42,960
Let's open it up by typing in IMG. We also need to specify the image that we want to use. We need to

261
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:50,160
specify the image source. So we'll use an attribute called src. Then let's enter an equals and open

262
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:57,360
quotes and then here we'll type in the file name. It's called kcclogo.png and then we'll close the

263
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,800
parentheses and here let's enter in the greater than sign and next let's save it. All we need is

264
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,160
this one tag. We don't have to open and then close it. It basically stands alone similar to the line

265
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,200
break. Now that I saved the file on the right hand side, let's refresh the page and look at that.

266
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:22,480
We now have the logo on the page but it's a little bit big. Over on the left hand side,

267
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,480
we can also define the height and also the width of this image. To define the width,

268
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,560
we're going to use the width attribute. Now type in width equals and then insert quotes and I want

269
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:42,320
this to be 400 pixels wide so I'll enter in just 400. We can also define the height by using the

270
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:49,200
height attribute. I'll type in height, insert quotes and this will be 122 pixels high. Then

271
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
I'll save this file and on the right hand side, let's click on refresh and look at that. That

272
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,560
looks a lot better. Another benefit of specifying the width and the height is that the browser knows

273
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:05,760
to reserve this space for an image before it's able to completely load the image. If you've ever

274
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,280
been to a website where the content jumps around, if it hasn't all loaded yet, that's typically

275
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,400
because they haven't defined the width and the height of the different elements on the page.

276
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,920
It's a good practice to always do that for every single image.

277
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,880
There's one more attribute that I recommend including as part of the image element

278
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,360
and that's the alt description. Here I'll enter it in, alt equals and then insert quotes and here

279
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:39,600
I can define what this image is. I'll call it the Kevin Cookie Company logo and now I'll save it.

280
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,000
Now when I refresh the page, you don't notice any difference but let's say that someone comes to

281
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,560
this website using a screen reader or maybe they're blind and they can't actually see what

282
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:54,400
this logo is. With the alt text, they'll be able to hear that it's the Kevin Cookie Company logo

283
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,040
and just for demonstration purposes, I'm going to misspell the name of the file and save it and

284
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,400
then refresh the page. Here you'll notice that it's not able to load the logo yet but you see

285
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,640
this text that identifies what it should be. So anytime you add an image to a page, it's always

286
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,880
good to include these four attributes including the source, the width, the height and also the

287
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,920
alt text. I'll now return it to the previous file name. Not only can you insert images but you can

288
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:27,120
also insert other types of media like audio and video. Down at the very bottom of this file,

289
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,960
I'll insert some new lines and here I'll paste in two additional elements, one of them for audio and

290
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,640
one of them for video and it follows a very similar structure to an image. Over here we

291
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,240
call out that this is audio and here you define what the source is. Here I type in the name of

292
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,760
the audio file. We insert controls because I want it to show audio controls so you could play or

293
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,040
stop the playing and here you could also define the type. Now unlike with image, we also use a

294
00:28:55,040 --> 00:29:00,240
closing tag. That's because this element is newer and this has been incorporated into that element

295
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,080
and video is very similar to audio. When I save this over on the right hand side, I'll refresh

296
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,240
and here we see an audio player controls and down below we see the video player.

297
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,240
If you're interested in using audio or video, do you know that you have additional attributes that

298
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,920
you can use? Maybe you want the audio to loop or maybe you want it to auto play although that one

299
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:26,480
can be a little bit annoying. With videos, you could also incorporate subtitles and you have

300
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,360
many other options as well. This is just to let you know that you can insert many different types

301
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,080
of media into your HTML page. We have a lot of compelling content on this page now. There's text,

302
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,680
there's recipe, there's audio, and there's video. I think what we really need now is an order form

303
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:50,080
where people can order some of these cookies. Let's open up File Explorer once again. Within

304
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:57,600
File Explorer, let's right click, go down to new, and let's click on text document and let's add a

305
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:06,000
new HTML file called order form dot HTML. Then let's click yes on this dialog and let's now open

306
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,880
this file in Notepad. I now have Notepad open with the order form dot HTML and over on the right hand

307
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,560
side, I have the browser window that shows me what this HTML file looks like. Currently, there's

308
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,120
nothing in this HTML file, which is why the browser window is empty. First, I want to include a table

309
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,080
that lists out all of the cookies that we offer here at the Kevin Cookie Company and the associated

310
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:36,480
price. I'm going to use the table element. I'm going to paste in some HTML. Right here,

311
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
we see that I'm setting up a new paragraph and down at the bottom, I close the paragraph.

312
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:46,320
Here, I use the table element. Right here, I open it up and down at the bottom, we close it again

313
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,160
with the closing tag. In a table, it's made up of multiple rows and also multiple columns. Here,

314
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:02,240
I'm setting up the first row of this table. We use the element TR. This stands for table row

315
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,000
and down here, I close it again. This is the first row in the table and within this row,

316
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,760
I have two columns, the cookie type and also the price. I refer to this element as TH. What does

317
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,280
that stand for? This is table header. This is letting my browser know that this is the header

318
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,320
of the table. Down here, I then have another row in my table. I use table row and then here,

319
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,960
I close table row. Here, too, I also have two columns, except this one is referred to as TD.

320
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,400
What's the difference between TD and TH? TD stands for table data. It's not the header row. This is

321
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,520
now where all the data within the table lives. Here, I have one cookie called chocolate chip

322
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,280
and it costs $4.50. I'll save this file and over on the right-hand side, let's now refresh the

323
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,240
browser window to see what this looks like. There, I have a very basic table. Of course,

324
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,280
when we look at the table over on the right-hand side, it's a little bit difficult to make out that

325
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,400
this is in fact a table. Over on the left-hand side, we can add an attribute that adds a border

326
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,320
to this table. Here, I'll type in border and let's say equals one. I'll save the file and on the

327
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:22,640
right-hand side, let's refresh and now, we can see a border around this table. To add additional

328
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,360
rows here, I'll copy this row and let's paste it in and maybe we also have, let's say, an oatmeal

329
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,480
raisin cookie. We'll say oatmeal raisin and this one goes for $2.50. I'll save it. Over on the

330
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,840
right-hand side, let's refresh and here, we now see another row in this table. This is a very simple

331
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,880
view of how you can create tables. There are many more attributes you can use. You could even have

332
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,200
certain columns span over multiple columns, so there are all sorts of different options here,

333
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,880
but this just gives you an idea of how you can use tables to represent data just like this.

334
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,720
Now that we've included a table listing out all of our different products and the associated price,

335
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,440
I'd like to add a very simple form that people can use to order some of these cookies.

336
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,320
Over on the left-hand side, I'll insert a new line and here, I'll paste in some very basic HTML to

337
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,800
add a form. Here, I use the form element. We open it and down at the bottom, we close it and there

338
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,160
are some very simple elements within here. Let me save this HTML page and over on the right-hand side,

339
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,120
let's refresh it to see what it looks like. Here, I have a label for the cookie type and here, we

340
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,080
see the label show up. To the right of that, I have an input field and here, we have input name

341
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,400
and this adds that input field. Down below, I use the same structure for the quantity and also the

342
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,840
delivery date. Now, instead of just using an input field for the delivery date, here, I could use one

343
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,920
of the attributes. I'll type in type equals and let's set this to date, save and refresh and this

344
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,480
now adds a date picker. The browser has tremendous functionality when it comes to displaying forms

345
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,040
via HTML. There are all sorts of different elements you can use. You can add drop-down

346
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,760
lists, you can add password fields, you can add radio buttons, check boxes, all sorts of different

347
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,440
things as you build out your forms. This is more just to give you a quick tour of what's possible

348
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,080
with forms and especially if you want to build them out, I recommend going deeper on this topic.

349
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,400
We've now looked at many of the different available elements within HTML,

350
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,600
but up to this point, we haven't yet formed a proper HTML page. To do that, in Notepad,

351
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:38,240
let's click back over into the index.html file. Back within the index.html file, down below,

352
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,440
we see all of the content that's displayed on the page. But what if we want to include a title that

353
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,280
shows up on the tab or what if we want to include a description for search engines? That wouldn't

354
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,800
be visible on the page, but we still need to pass that information to the browser. And so far,

355
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,800
we've just been focusing on the body content, but we need to structure this as a proper HTML page.

356
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,720
At the top, let's add a few new lines and then go to the very top line. At the very top,

357
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,480
I'm going to add an element that tells the browser that this is in fact an HTML document type.

358
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:22,000
We'll type in doc type and then HTML. Next, we need to tell the browser that all this content

359
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
that appears below is in fact HTML. So we're going to use a block element to do that. Here,

360
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,440
I'll type in HTML and at the very bottom, let's add it again, but this time we're going to close

361
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,320
it off. Now the browser knows that all this content stored within is HTML. And now we want

362
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,720
to separate this out into two separate sections. We have the head where we can pass information

363
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,360
that's not visually displayed on the page. And then we also have the body content. So right at

364
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,120
the very top, I'm going to add a block element called head. I'll copy it and down below,

365
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,720
let's close it out. And right down here, I'll add one called body, open it and down below,

366
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,280
I'll close it out. Now that I've added all of those, let me apply some indentation,

367
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,840
just so everything's a little bit easier to see. I've now applied some indentation,

368
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,480
so hopefully everything's a little bit easier to parse. Throughout this video,

369
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,520
we've been focused on the body section of the HTML document, basically everything that's

370
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,920
visually shown on the page. Let's now shift our focus to the head. The head contains all of the

371
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,840
metadata about the page, basically all of the stuff that the web browser needs to know,

372
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:44,560
but that won't be shown. Right up here, I'll paste into examples of the types of content that

373
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,600
you would put here. I've included a title, the Kevin Cookie Company homepage, and also the

374
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:57,200
description. This is what search engines can pick up. Over here, if we scroll over, the description

375
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,040
is the Kevin Cookie Company is the best cookie company in the world. Now, if I save this right

376
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,080
now, over on the right-hand side, I'll refresh the page and you'll notice that none of the body has

377
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,000
changed. But if we look at the very top, you'll now see that the tab name is titled Kevin Cookie

378
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,760
Company homepage. It's taking the title that I provide here. We also have a description,

379
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,840
so let's say that search engines now index this page. They'll take this description into account.

380
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,800
You could put lots of different things into the head. You could also include, let's say,

381
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,480
a favicon. You could also load various CSS, which affects the look and feel of the page.

382
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,080
You could even load up different JavaScript that you want to use on the page.

383
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,680
So there are lots of different items that you could put within the head of your page.

384
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,640
Under the head, we have the body section of our page. And again, this is what we focused

385
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,320
on for most of the video. And this is all of the content that's displayed visually on the page.

386
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,280
Now you might be wondering, well, when we started creating this HTML page,

387
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,160
how is it that it worked without all of this structure in place? Well, the reason why is

388
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,240
HTML is very resilient. Even though we didn't include HTML, the web browser assumed that this

389
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,000
was an HTML document. So it continued to work. However, to structure an HTML page properly,

390
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,800
I recommend using these key building blocks every single time you set up an HTML page.

391
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,840
All right. Well, thank you so much for helping with this basic HTML website for the Kevin

392
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:33,200
Cookie Company. I am sure we're going to sell a lot of cookies. Of course, there are many more

393
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,120
HTML elements and also attributes. To learn more, I've included resources down below in

394
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,080
