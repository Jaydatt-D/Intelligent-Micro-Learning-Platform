            "[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  I'm just going to give a basic idea of what these do and how the syntax works and everything else.\n",
            "[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  Even if you have no idea what this is, just follow along, and I think you'll be able to understand,\n",

            "[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor.\n",
            "[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  So, it's a server-side scripting language which is generally used to write scripts which run on the server.\n",
            "[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  So, in simple terms, it's like a script which connects the front-end part with a back-end, that is the database.\n",
            "[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  So, it's like if you want to do some operations on the data which is taken from the front-end,\n",
            "[01:12.000 --> 01:16.000]  and maybe you want to take that information and place it in the database,\n",
            "[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  then you're going to use PHP which connects with the database and executes queries or things onto the database.\n",
            "[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  In a similar way, it's going to take the data from the database and display it onto the front-end part.\n",
            "[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  So, it's like a bridge between these two, and PHP is a language which generally runs on servers.\n",
            "[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  So, if you want to actually execute PHP on your computer, you have to have a server installed on your computer.\n",
            "[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  There are many servers out there, but the one that I'm using right now for this video is XAMPP or XAMPP.\n",
            "[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  So, it's a bundle of different softwares, and in that, a server is also present, it's an Apache server,\n",
            "[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  and it also comes with PHP bundle, so you don't need to manually install PHP onto your system.\n",
            "[01:55.000 --> 01:58.000]  So, if you install XAMPP, automatically everything will be set up for you.\n",

            "[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  I'll provide a link in the description down below.\n",
            "[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  You can go to that link and see the video on how to install XAMPP, I've already done that.\n",
            "[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  So, once I'm done installing that, then you can carry on from here.\n",
            "[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Alright, so now let's go into the project structure.\n",
            "[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  So, in my Visual Studio code, what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a file and name it as practice.php.\n",
            "[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  So, observe here that I'm trying to name practice.php.\n",
            "[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  So, I'm giving .php extinction as this is a PHP file.\n",
            "[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  Alright, the first thing that you have to know when it comes to PHP is that you have to write PHP inside a specific tag.\n",
            "[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  So, it's something like this.\n",
            "[02:34.000 --> 02:39.000]  So, this is the PHP tag, so this is the opening tag, and this is the closing tag.\n",
            "[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  This implies that whatever is written in between these two tags is PHP.\n",
            "[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  Everything else that is written outside of these two tags is not considered PHP even though the file is named as PHP.\n",
            "[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  That is because you can write HTML inside of PHP as well.\n",
            "[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  So, if you want, you can just type in the HTML code below here and you can place your PHP above the HTML as well.\n",
            "[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  Or you can use PHP in between HTML as well.\n",
            "[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  So, you have to specify these two tags whenever you're trying to use PHP.\n",
            "[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  Alright, so the first thing that we're going to see is how to print data onto the screen.\n",
            "[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  So, we're going to use a function called as echo.\n",
            "[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  So, echo is a function which is generally used to print data onto the screen and this is its syntax.\n",
            "[03:23.000 --> 03:29.000]  So, here I'm going to output a string and save it.\n",
            "[03:29.000 --> 03:36.000]  So, now if you want to execute this, what you have to do is you have to go to your exam control panel and start the server.\n",
            "[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  Once you've done that, then you have to go to your browser and type in localhost.\n",
            "[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  So, I'm going to quickly go to the file that we had created earlier.\n",
            "[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  Okay, so this is the file that we have. If I zoom in a bit, so you're able to see the text, right?\n",
            "[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  So, we're using echo to print the data onto the screen.\n",
            "[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  So, the second thing that we're going to see is comments.\n",
            "[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  So, if you're going to create a single line comment in PHP, you have to give it two slashes and that is going to create a comment.\n",
            "[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  So, if you're going to create a multi-line comment, you're going to type in.\n",
            "[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  So, this is a multi-line comment. Anything that is placed in between will become a comment.\n",
            "[04:17.000 --> 04:20.000]  So, next thing that we're going to see are variables.\n",
            "[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  So, variables are like containers in which you can store data.\n",
            "[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  In other languages like C, C++, Java, you have to specifically define the type of data that you want to store.\n",
            "[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  If you want to store int or integer, you have to type in int or if you want to store strings, you have to type in string.\n",
            "[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  But, here in PHP, you don't need to explicitly define what data type that you're going to use.\n",
            "[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  You can just type in dollar a is equal to 10.\n",
            "[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  Here, dollar represents that this is a variable and the value of 10 is being assigned to a.\n",
            "[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  And, as you can see here, we haven't defined what data type a is.\n",
            "[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  It's just going to take the value and automatically define its data type implicitly.\n",
            "[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  You don't have to define that it's int.\n",
            "[05:01.000 --> 05:09.000]  You can just give it as text as well or string or you can give it a float value as well.\n",
            "[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  Anything is fine. Everything is accepted here.\n",
            "[05:12.000 --> 05:16.000]  And, one more thing that you have to keep in mind is that you have to end each line with a semicolon.\n",
            "[05:16.000 --> 05:22.000]  Semicolon is what defines the end of a line and that's the end of an instruction.\n",
            "[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  Then, the interpreter or compiler can just go to the next line and execute that.\n",
            "[05:26.000 --> 05:28.000]  So, now you can echo out the value.\n",
            "[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  So, I'm going to echo out dollar a and save it.\n",
            "[05:31.000 --> 05:36.000]  So, if you now go to the browser and refresh, as you can see here, 10 is being outputted.\n",
            "[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  That's the value that we had assigned it.\n",
            "[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  Let's echo out the value of b as well.\n",
            "[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  And, I'm going to change the value of a to let's say.\n",
            "[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  So, now if you save that and go to the browser.\n",
            "[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  So, as you can see here, the text is being printed.\n",
            "[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  There's no space here and the data is not being printed onto the next line.\n",
            "[05:56.000 --> 05:58.000]  It's just being printed on a single line.\n",
            "[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  So, if you want to change that, what you can do is, in between these two echo statements,\n",
            "[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  you can echo out another statement and it's going to be a HTML tag.\n",
            "[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  So, I'm going to echo out a br tag and save it.\n",
            "[06:12.000 --> 06:17.000]  Now, if you go to the browser and refresh, as you can see here, 20 has been shifted to the next line.\n",
            "[06:17.000 --> 06:20.000]  So, in this way, you can echo out HTML inside of PHP.\n",
            "[06:20.000 --> 06:28.000]  So, if you want to echo, let's say, horizontal line, as you can see here, the line has been printed.\n",
            "[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  Similarly, you can echo out multiple statements consisting of headings, paragraphs, links and all of that.\n",
            "[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  Anything can be echoed out.\n",
            "[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  So, the next thing that we're going to see are operations.\n",
            "[06:37.000 --> 06:46.000]  So, I'm just going to quickly type in all the operations that we can generally use.\n",
            "[06:46.000 --> 06:51.000]  So, these are the operations that we generally use inside of PHP or any other language in a sense.\n",
            "[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  So, these are the basic operations that we use.\n",
            "[06:54.000 --> 07:01.000]  So, what I'm doing here is that I'm just adding a to b and assigning that value to a variable called as $r.\n",
            "[07:01.000 --> 07:07.000]  I'm doing the same thing here except I'm doing subtraction, then multiplication, division or you can do modular division as well.\n",
            "[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to just change this from text to, let's say, a number 20 and save it.\n",
            "[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  So, now I'm just going to comment out everything else except the addition part.\n",
            "[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  And then below this, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to echo out the value of $r.\n",
            "[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  We'll just echo out this as well. We don't need this and save it.\n",
            "[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  As you can see here, 30 has been printed. That is 20 plus 10 is equal to 30.\n",
            "[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  So, the same thing will happen with all the other operations as well.\n",
            "[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  So, I'm just going to comment out this and do one more operation.\n",
            "[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  So, I'm going to do the modular operation and save it and refresh.\n",
            "[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  So, as you can see here, 10 is being outputted.\n",
            "[07:41.000 --> 07:49.000]  So, now let's say instead of echoing out the variable directly, let's say you want to echo out some text before the variable or after the variable.\n",
            "[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  And in between that, you want to actually echo out this variable as well.\n",
            "[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  So, what you're going to do is that you're going to concatenate.\n",
            "[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  So, what does that mean?\n",
            "[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  So, I'm just going to first type the text.\n",
            "[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  So, this is the result and give a colon space.\n",
            "[08:04.000 --> 08:10.000]  Then what I'm going to do is, I'm going to give it dot and then I'm going to give the variable that you want to echo out.\n",
            "[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  So, essentially what we're doing here is that we're concatenating this text with this variable.\n",
            "[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  Concatenation means adding the data to the end or the starting, wherever you put it actually.\n",
            "[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  So, it's like adding or extending the data itself.\n",
            "[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  So, I'm just concatenating this string with this variable.\n",
            "[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  If you want, you can add one more text here.\n",
            "[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  Let's say, test something like that and just save it.\n",
            "[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  And if you go to the browser and refresh.\n",
            "[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  So, as you can see here, the result is being printed.\n",
            "[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  Okay, so now let's comment this and the next thing that we're going to do is we're going to see conditional statements.\n",
            "[08:44.000 --> 08:52.000]  So, by conditional statements, what I mean is that, let's say you want to write a logic where you want to execute a particular statement if something is true.\n",
            "[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  If that is not true, then you're going to execute something else, right?\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 09:12.000]  So, let's say I have something like this.\n",
            "[09:12.000 --> 09:18.000]  So, what we're doing is that we're checking if $a or that variable is greater than $b.\n",
            "[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  If that is true, then execute this statement that is a is greater than b.\n",
            "[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  If not, check if a is equivalent to b.\n",
            "[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  If that is true, then execute this.\n",
            "[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  Else, if both of these are not true, then you're going to execute this, which is a is smaller than b.\n",
            "[09:31.000 --> 09:35.000]  So, if you observe here, we're using two equal to's and not single.\n",
            "[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  That is because we generally use a single equal to when you're trying to actually assign a variable.\n",
            "[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  As you can see here, we first did that operation, right?\n",
            "[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  After we had done the operations on a and b, we're assigning that result value to a variable called $r.\n",
            "[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  In that case, we're using an equal to to assign a variable.\n",
            "[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  Here, we're using double equal to to check if both of these entities are equal or not.\n",
            "[09:56.000 --> 09:57.000]  Okay, remember that.\n",
            "[09:57.000 --> 09:59.000]  So, this is a simple FL structure.\n",
            "[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Now, let's comment this out and what we're going to do is we're going to execute this and go to the browser and refresh.\n",
            "[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  And as you can see, it's showing that a is smaller than b.\n",
            "[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  That is because the value of a is currently 10.\n",
            "[10:11.000 --> 10:12.000]  What if we change it to 50?\n",
            "[10:12.000 --> 10:15.000]  Now, let's go to the browser and refresh.\n",
            "[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  As you can see, a is greater than b.\n",
            "[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  Now, if it is equivalent, then let's save that and see that a is equal to b.\n",
            "[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  So, the FL statements are working right now.\n",
            "[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  So, I'm just going to comment this out, okay?\n",
            "[10:27.000 --> 10:30.000]  So, the next thing that we're going to take a look at is arrays.\n",
            "[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  So, an array is a data structure.\n",
            "[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  So, if you have a computer science background, then you already know what arrays are.\n",
            "[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  But if you have no idea what array is, in simple terms, an array is a collection of data, right?\n",
            "[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  So, it's like a continuous stream of collection of data inside the computer's memory, okay?\n",
            "[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  So, it's like a row in which you place all the data consecutively, right?\n",
            "[10:52.000 --> 11:02.000]  So, the way that you define an array inside PHP is like this.\n",
            "[11:02.000 --> 11:04.000]  So, I have a variable here called as index array.\n",
            "[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  In that, I've defined three values.\n",
            "[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  The first one is the character a, the second one is the character b, and the third one is the character c.\n",
            "[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  So, as you can see here, all three of them are of similar data type.\n",
            "[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  And in any other language like C or C++, you have to define an array which is of same data type, right?\n",
            "[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  You cannot define an element inside of an array which is different from all the other elements inside that array.\n",
            "[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  It's like you can't define it as one, two, three, four.\n",
            "[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  See, so you can't define one, two, three, four with the characters here.\n",
            "[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  That is with other languages.\n",
            "[11:34.000 --> 11:39.000]  But with PHP, you can define an integer along with other characters as well.\n",
            "[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  So, this is of character type, this is of int type.\n",
            "[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  You can define another float value as well inside the array and PHP will not mind it.\n",
            "[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  It will take that array and it's going to execute its operations on it.\n",
            "[11:51.000 --> 11:57.000]  So, the reason why I've given it as index array is because in PHP, we have two types of arrays.\n",
            "[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  The first one is called as index array where we use indices that is numbers to represent each and every value.\n",
            "[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  So, here for this array, the first value is given an id of zero.\n",

            "[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  The third one is given an id of three and so on.\n",
            "[12:13.000 --> 12:16.000]  So, you have to remember that arrays start from zero.\n",
            "[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  So, it's going to start from zero, then one, two and three.\n",
            "[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  So, let's say you want to print out the value of b, right?\n",
            "[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to type in echo and I'm going to take the variable index underscore array\n",
            "[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  and I'm going to pass in the value of one and semicolon and save it.\n",
            "[12:34.000 --> 12:40.000]  So, the reason why I've given it as one is because I've said it earlier, arrays start from zero.\n",
            "[12:40.000 --> 12:45.000]  So, if this value is represented with the number zero, then b is represented with the number one.\n",
            "[12:45.000 --> 12:50.000]  So, if you type that and save it and refresh the page, as you can see here, b is being printed.\n",
            "[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  Now, if I change it to zero and save it and refresh, as you can see here, a is being printed.\n",
            "[12:55.000 --> 13:02.000]  So, arrays start from zero and if you keep it as let's say three and save it, so it's going to print one, two, three, four.\n",
            "[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  So, this is the syntax of printing the elements inside of an array.\n",
            "[13:06.000 --> 13:10.000]  So, the second type of arrays that we generally have are called as associative arrays.\n",
            "[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  So, in other programming languages, they are known as dictionaries or maps or something like that.\n",

            "[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  So, an associative array is similar to an index array, but instead of having indices, we're going to have key value pairs.\n",

            "[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  So, this is how we define an associative array.\n",
            "[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  Here, as you can see here, we have two values representing each and every element, right?\n",
            "[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  So, this is what is called as a key and this is called as a value.\n",

            "[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  So, this whole thing is a single element and this is another element and so on.\n",
            "[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  So, if you want to print out the values inside of an associative array, you're going to refer to the pencils, that is the key.\n",
            "[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  So, if you remember in the index arrays, we used Ids, right?\n",
            "[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  Which were not defined first, but it was defined by the programming language itself and it was given as 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n",

            "[14:46.000 --> 14:52.000]  So, associative arrays have key and value pairs and the keys don't necessarily have to be a string.\n",
            "[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  You can have a number as well.\n",
            "[14:54.000 --> 15:01.000]  So, it can be something like, let's say, 1 and the value can be, let's say, test.\n",

            "[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  So, what are loops?\n",
            "[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  So, let's say you have a statement.\n",
            "[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  It's called, hey this is Kamal and you have to print that string 50 times.\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  So, what you can do?\n",
            "[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  You can just type the echo statement 50 times and for each echo statement, you can just give that same string.\n",
            "[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  But, that's tedious work, right?\n",
            "[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  So, what you're going to do is you're going to create a loop in which it's going to execute that particular statement 50 number of times.\n",
            "[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  So, that's the better way of printing the statements, right?\n",
            "[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  So, in PHP, we have mainly 3 types of loops.\n",
            "[15:52.000 --> 16:05.000]  So, the first one is a furl loop and it's something like this.\n",
            "[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  So, this is the syntax of a furl loop and a furl loop consists of 3 statements.\n",

            "[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  The value of i is initialized to 0.\n",
            "[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  Then, it's going to check if i is less than 20.\n",
            "[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  0 is less than 20, that is true.\n",
            "[16:19.000 --> 16:21.000]  So, it's going to echo out that value.\n",
            "[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  Then, it's going to increment the value of i.\n",
            "[16:23.000 --> 16:28.000]  Then, it's going to go and check if that incremented value is less than 20.\n",
            "[16:28.000 --> 16:31.000]  Since it was 0, now the value of i has been incremented to 1.\n",

            "[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  It's going to echo it again and increment again.\n",
            "[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  This statement is going to keep on executing till the value of i is equal to 20.\n",
            "[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  So, now if you save that and go to the browser and refresh.\n",
            "[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  As you can see here, the numbers have been printed till 19.\n",
            "[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  That is because we have started it from 0.\n",
            "[16:57.000 --> 17:02.000]  If you give it as 1, then you have to give it here as equal to then save it and refresh.\n",

            "[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  So, the second type of loops that we have are known as while loops.\n",
            "[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  So, the syntax is something like this.\n",
            "[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  So, what I have written here is that the while loop is going to first check if the value of a is less than value of b.\n",
            "[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  Initially, the value of a is 20 and the value of b is 20.\n",
            "[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  Before that, we have to first change the value of 20.\n",
            "[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  So, I'm going to go to the top and change the value to 10.\n",
            "[17:34.000 --> 17:39.000]  At the bottom, now what it's going to do is that it's going to check whether the value of a is less than value of b.\n",
            "[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  Initially, the value of a is 10 and the value of b is 20.\n",

            "[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  Then, it's going to increment it by 1.\n",
            "[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  $a++ implies the value is being incremented by 1.\n",
            "[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  Here is the same thing as well.\n",
            "[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  $i++ implies that the value has been increased by 1.\n",
            "[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  So, now if you see that and go to the browser and refresh the page.\n",
            "[17:58.000 --> 18:06.000]  As you can see here, from 10 everything has been printed till 90 because the value we have given it as is less than and not equal to.\n",
            "[18:06.000 --> 18:11.000]  If you give it as equal to as well, then save it and refresh the page once again.\n",
            "[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  20 has been added as well.\n",
            "[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  So, that's the while loop.\n",
            "[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  So, the last loop that we're going to look at is known as a for each loop.\n",
            "[18:18.000 --> 18:30.000]  So, the syntax for that is something like this.\n",
            "[18:30.000 --> 18:40.000]  So, what the statement means is that for each element inside of the sx2 array, take that element as $ar and echo out that value.\n",
            "[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  So, now if you save this and go to the browser and refresh.\n",
            "[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  As you can see here, we have the three values that is test, test2 and test2.\n",
            "[18:48.000 --> 18:51.000]  So, these were the values that we had defined earlier.\n",
            "[18:51.000 --> 19:01.000]  So, it's going to take all the elements inside of the sx2 array as $ar and it's going to print the value associated with the id or with the key so to say.\n",
            "[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  So, this is the for each loop.\n",
            "[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  So, the last thing that we're going to look at is form handling.\n",
            "[19:06.000 --> 19:11.000]  So, to actually explain form handling, we need a form inside of HTML page.\n",
            "[19:11.000 --> 19:28.000]  So, I'm going to create that now.\n",
            "[19:28.000 --> 19:40.000]  Okay, so what I've done here is that I've created a file called as index.php and if you observe, I've given the extension .php and as I mentioned earlier, you can write HTML inside of PHP as well and that is going to work.\n",
            "[19:40.000 --> 19:53.000]  So, now inside this index page, what I've done is that I've created the basic boiler template and in that, I've created a dummy form and in that form, I've created a single input tag and below that, I have a button which says click me.\n",
            "[19:53.000 --> 20:03.000]  So, for the input, I've given it a name property called as username and for the form, I've given it an action property called as practice.php.\n",
            "[20:03.000 --> 20:16.000]  So, when you click on this button, what's going to happen is that the data is being taken from the input tag and being assigned to a name called as username and then it is being sent to the practice.php using the method get.\n",
            "[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  So, there are actually four types of methods that we generally use but for this video, two are enough.\n",
            "[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  The first one is the get method and the second one is the post method.\n",
            "[20:25.000 --> 20:33.000]  So, we're going to first see the get method. So, now if you save this and go to the browser and go to index.php.\n",
            "[20:33.000 --> 20:39.000]  So, now we have this form right. So, if I type in let's say camel and click me.\n",
            "[20:39.000 --> 20:52.000]  As you can see here in the browser, automatically index.php has been removed and it has been redirected to practice.php and also a variable called as username has been assigned a value called as camel which was defined by me.\n",
            "[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  So, now we have the data present inside the URL. Now, we have to take the data and do something with it right.\n",
            "[20:59.000 --> 21:17.000]  So, now let's go to the practice page and here below everything else, what we're going to do is that we're going to write an if statement and it's going to be something like this.\n",
            "[21:17.000 --> 21:30.000]  So, what I'm doing here is that I'm checking if this username variable is being set inside the URL and that too we're explicitly checking if a get method is being used to set this username variable.\n",
            "[21:30.000 --> 21:41.000]  And as you can see here in the form use the get method and we actually gave an input as username and we actually got the data inside the URL which is being equal or being assigned to username.\n",
            "[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  So, now if you refresh the page, the data is being taken from the username and it is being printed right.\n",
            "[21:47.000 --> 21:54.000]  So, let's see if I give it as the second method that is post and save it.\n",
            "[21:54.000 --> 22:00.000]  Now, if you go back, so I'm going to type the same thing again and click me.\n",
            "[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  So, now as you can see here the data is not being passed to the URL.\n",
            "[22:04.000 --> 22:15.000]  So, there is nothing after practice.php but if you go to the practice page and remove this get and type in post and also change this as well.\n",
            "[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  Now, if I save this and go to the browser and refresh, click on continue.\n",
            "[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  As you can see here the data is being printed but there is no data inside the URL.\n",
            "[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  That means the data is being passed but it has been hidden.\n",
            "[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  So, we generally use get or post methods to pass data in between files inside of PHP.\n",
            "[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  So, this is how you take the data from a form and pass it to another PHP file and do some operations with it.\n",
            "[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  So, this is generally how a login form or a signup form or a contact me form works.\n",
            "[22:47.000 --> 22:59.000]  Generally take the data from this and pass it here and instead of echoing out we generally type in some SQL queries where it's going to take the data and push it onto the database where you have a login table.\n",
            "[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  And all the data has been stored there.\n",
            "[23:03.000 --> 23:10.000]  So, apart from get and post we also have another method here which is called as request.\n",
            "[23:10.000 --> 23:15.000]  So, we generally use request only when we have no idea how we are passing the data.\n",
            "[23:15.000 --> 23:24.000]  So, let's say you are given it as post but let's say you have many forms inside your website and you actually have no idea what method you are actually using to send the data through the URL.\n",
            "[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  Then what you can do is you can give it request and it's going to accept get or post as well.\n",
            "[23:28.000 --> 23:35.000]  So, as you can see here it's an associative array that by default contains the contents of get, post and cookie as well.\n",
            "[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  So, it's going to accept all of these three.\n",
            "[23:37.000 --> 23:44.000]  So, now if you save this and go to the browser and refresh the same thing is being printed that means it is still working.\n",
            "[23:44.000 --> 23:48.000]  So, that's how you take the data from the form and print it out.\n",
            "[23:48.000 --> 23:53.000]  So, post is used when you actually have to send sensitive data like username and passwords.\n",
            "[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  And get is used when you have to pass data which is not required any prediction at all.\n",
            "[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  Yeah, and one more thing is that actually forgot one concept inside of PHP.\n",
            "[24:03.000 --> 24:07.000]  So, the last thing that we are going to cover is we are going to use functions.\n",
            "[24:07.000 --> 24:15.000]  So, a function is like a block of code that you can write independently and you can execute it as many times as you want.\n",
            "[24:15.000 --> 24:25.000]  So, the syntax of function is something like this.\n",
            "[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  Okay, so there is something wrong with my editor that's why it's showing this red line.\n",
            "[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  But anyway, so this is the syntax for writing a function inside PHP.\n",
            "[24:32.000 --> 24:39.000]  So, what I've done here is that I've defined a keyword called as function and beside that I've given the name for the function.\n",
            "[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  And inside the function what I've written is that hey this is coming.\n",
            "[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  So, if you want to execute this particular set of code what you have to do is that you have to call this function.\n",
            "[24:47.000 --> 24:54.000]  What I'm doing here is that below this I've just written that and if you just write the statement here that means you are trying to call this function.\n",
            "[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  And as soon as this function is called it's going to go in and execute whatever is present inside this function.\n",
            "[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  So, if you save this and go to the browser and refresh the page as you can see here.\n",
            "[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  So, the text is being shown that means the function is being executed.\n",
            "[25:09.000 --> 25:17.000]  So, this is how you generally define functions and functions are very useful when you have to execute a particular code multiple number of times.\n",
            "[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  I'm not talking about loops but I'm talking about reusable codes.\n",
            "[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  So, if you write a logic inside of a function and if you want to use that logic anywhere inside of your PHP project.\n",
            "[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  What you can do is that you can just call the function and as soon as that is called it's going to execute whatever is there inside the function.\n",
            "[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  And that is generally the logic that you have written before.\n",
            "[25:36.000 --> 25:41.000]  So, those were the basics of PHP and I know that I haven't touched all the topics in PHP itself.\n",
            "[25:41.000 --> 25:48.000]  But believe me this is more than enough for you to know if you want to create a simple website using PHP with integration of backend and frontend as well.\n",
            "[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  So, these concepts will be enough for you.\n",
            "[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  But if you want to create something which is much more advanced and you have to learn some more concepts and this is like just the tip of the iceberg.\n",
            "[25:56.000 --> 26:05.000]  There are many more concepts that you have to learn but if you want to get started this is more than enough and these concepts will be enough for you to create a simple website.\n",
            "[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  So, there is one last tip before ending this video.\n",
            "[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  So, instead of writing all the PHP code inside of a separate file.\n",
            "[26:12.000 --> 26:21.000]  What you can do is that you can just take the data from the PHP and remove that from there and paste it inside the main index page itself.\n",
            "[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  So, let's say you have this form right.\n",
            "[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  So, if you want to actually execute this what you have to do is that you have to create another file called as practice.php.\n",
            "[26:31.000 --> 26:35.000]  And in that file you have to specify the logic that you want to use.\n",
            "[26:35.000 --> 26:39.000]  But instead of doing that what you can do is that you can just remove this action itself.\n",
            "[26:39.000 --> 26:46.000]  And what's going to happen is that whenever you click on this click me automatically the data is being sent to the same page.\n",
            "[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  That is the execution is going to start and end in the index page.\n",
            "[26:50.000 --> 27:00.000]  So, since the PHP is already present inside the index page that is above the HTML automatically when you click on this it's going to go to this function and it's going to execute this.\n",
            "[27:00.000 --> 27:10.000]  So, now if you go to the browser and let's say you go to index page and you type in let's say my name and click me.\n",
            "[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  As you can see here the data is being printed in the index page right.\n",
            "[27:15.000 --> 27:23.000]  So, the data can also be written inside the index page and you don't have to create another file to execute the form itself.\n",
            "[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  So, that's a pro tip that will help you guys a lot when you're trying to execute forms inside your web page.\n",

            "[00:05.000 --> 00:11.000]  In fact, I would say that learning Postgres and SQL has been one of the most beneficial skills\n",
            "[00:11.000 --> 00:15.000]  I've learned throughout my entire career. Not only has it been helpful on the job,\n",
            "[00:15.000 --> 00:21.000]  it's also been a really impressive skill to be able to flex in interviews with potential employers,\n",
            "[00:21.000 --> 00:27.000]  and I've landed multiple contract jobs just because I know Postgres well enough\n",
            "[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  to be able to do things that other developers simply can't.\n",
            "[00:30.000 --> 00:37.000]  Today, in this video, I'm going to give you some initial skills to help you on your journey to Postgres Mastery.\n",
            "[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  We're just going to be talking about a lot of the basics. Perhaps in future videos,\n",
            "[00:41.000 --> 00:44.000]  we'll dive a little bit deeper and talk about some more advanced concepts,\n",
            "[00:44.000 --> 00:49.000]  but this should lay the foundation for your journey to Postgres Mastery.\n",
            "[00:49.000 --> 00:52.000]  So without further ado, let's dive right in.\n",
            "[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  Well, the first question is, what is Postgres? What is SQL, really?\n",
            "[00:57.000 --> 01:04.000]  Well, Postgres is a relational database. You're going to hear a lot about relational and non-relational databases out there,\n",
            "[01:04.000 --> 01:09.000]  and an initial assumption a lot of developers might have, in fact, when I used to teach,\n",
            "[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  I would ask students a lot, what's your assumption? What do you think relational means versus non-relational?\n",
            "[01:14.000 --> 01:22.000]  And oftentimes, they would say, well, I would just assume that a relational database allows you to relate data together.\n",
            "[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  And while that's true, you can do that in a relational database.\n",
            "[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  What's also true is that you can do that in a non-relational database.\n",
            "[01:29.000 --> 01:34.000]  What it actually is talking about is the math under the hood, what makes the database tick.\n",
            "[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  In relational databases, it's leveraging relational algebra, and that's the reason for the name.\n",
            "[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  So that's just a common misconception that I wanted to clear up before we dove right into Postgres.\n",
            "[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  So SQL stands for Structured Query Language.\n",
            "[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  It's a language that allows us to communicate with our database and make changes by using a series of keywords.\n",
            "[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  We're going to dive into it a little bit more, but just setting the stage for the rest of our talk today.\n",
            "[02:01.000 --> 02:11.000]  So let's go ahead and talk about the core building block for essentially all SQL databases, which is tables.\n",
            "[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  Tables are essentially containers for data. They're made up of columns and rows.\n",
            "[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  You can think much like an Excel spreadsheet or a Google Sheets spreadsheet.\n",
            "[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  You're going to have a series of columns, and then you're going to have multiple rows.\n",
            "[02:26.000 --> 02:31.000]  Oftentimes, we'll talk about entries into a table as entities.\n",
            "[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  So if you ever hear me talk about an entity, I'm just talking about one object in the database.\n",
            "[02:37.000 --> 02:45.000]  So for example here, what I would say is maybe this first user here, he's an entity in the database.\n",
            "[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  What we can see is this is actually a screenshot from the editor that we'll be in soon.\n",
            "[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  We have a series of these columns here. So we've got an ID column, email column, name column, age column, and password column.\n",
            "[02:57.000 --> 03:07.000]  What you'll also see is that we have these rows. We have these entries into that table, and those rows have specific entries for each column.\n",
            "[03:07.000 --> 03:14.000]  So for example, for the email column, we're going to see troy at fake email dot com is this user's email address.\n",
            "[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  And then same for name, same for age, and password here. These are actually hashed.\n",
            "[03:19.000 --> 03:25.000]  You're never really going to store raw text passwords in a database. It's a huge security concern.\n",
            "[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  We're not going to talk about that much in this video. Maybe that's a great topic for future ones,\n",
            "[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  but I just wanted to explain why you're seeing that nonsense in the password column.\n",
            "[03:35.000 --> 03:43.000]  Okay, so let's jump over to an editor now, and let's create our first table together.\n",
            "[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  All right. So welcome to Postico. Postico is just an interface for interacting with Postgres.\n",
            "[03:49.000 --> 03:55.000]  I'll have some links for setting up Postgres on your local machine as well as Postico down below in the description.\n",
            "[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  But all you need to know for now is it's an editor that allows us to write SQL and interact with our database.\n",
            "[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  It also gives us a nice UI so that we can see things. It's fantastic for beginners.\n",
            "[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  So let's jump right in. So here, this is where we're going to write our SQL.\n",
            "[04:12.000 --> 04:20.000]  So, you know, we can type away as normal. But SQL, like I said, is made up of a series of keywords.\n",
            "[04:20.000 --> 04:28.000]  So what do I say when I mean keyword? Well, a keyword is just a word that tells SQL to do a very specific operation.\n",
            "[04:28.000 --> 04:35.000]  And in this example, what we want to do is tell SQL or tell Postgres, I should say, to create a table.\n",
            "[04:35.000 --> 04:45.000]  Okay, so what table are we creating today? Well, I think it's best to go through anything new that we're learning with a actual realistic example.\n",
            "[04:45.000 --> 04:54.000]  So we're going to build a little bit of a schema here that would represent an application that allows us to have users and posts eventually.\n",
            "[04:54.000 --> 05:02.000]  And when I say schema, all a schema is, is it's just the database itself. The way that data is laid out is the schema.\n",
            "[05:02.000 --> 05:10.000]  Okay, fantastic. So let's jump into it. First, we're going to create a table. I'm going to call the table profile for now.\n",
            "[05:10.000 --> 05:17.000]  I'm going to revisit that, but we'll come back to it. And then the syntax for this is after we say create table profile,\n",
            "[05:17.000 --> 05:25.000]  we open up these parentheses here. And then inside of here, each line, we're going to define a new column for that table.\n",
            "[05:25.000 --> 05:34.000]  Troy from the future here. Sorry for the interruption. I just want to note that SQL statements need to end in a semicolon.\n",
            "[05:34.000 --> 05:42.000]  I didn't specifically say that, which is my bad. But you'll notice that every statement that I write throughout this entire video ends in a semicolon.\n",
            "[05:42.000 --> 05:50.000]  It's how we tell SQL that the statement is done. So we always, whenever you're working with the database,\n",
            "[05:50.000 --> 05:57.000]  you need to make sure that you have an ID column. That column is going to be what we call a serial column.\n",
            "[05:57.000 --> 06:06.000]  And we're going to go ahead and also tell it that this is the primary key. The user might also have a name.\n",
            "[06:06.000 --> 06:13.000]  The name we're going to say is Varchar 255. And don't worry, I'm going to come back and talk through all of this.\n",
            "[06:13.000 --> 06:20.000]  What does this stuff mean? You might not know, but I think it's helpful to write it all out first so that you can see it together.\n",
            "[06:20.000 --> 06:25.000]  We're going to have an email. That's also going to be Varchar 255. We're going to have a password.\n",
            "[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  I'm going to make the password text. And then finally, we're going to have an age, which is an integer.\n",
            "[06:33.000 --> 06:42.000]  Okay, great. So what does all of this mean? And why are there these different capitalizations for certain words and some not?\n",
            "[06:42.000 --> 06:51.000]  Okay, so first things first, let's address capitalization. In programming languages, you're going to have a series of conventions oftentimes.\n",
            "[06:51.000 --> 06:56.000]  In languages like JavaScript, you're going to see a lot of camel cases. In Python, you're going to see a lot of snake casing.\n",
            "[06:56.000 --> 07:07.000]  In SQL, the convention is that you uppercase all keywords and anything that relates to your table itself should be lowercase snake case.\n",
            "[07:07.000 --> 07:14.000]  So all lowercase characters snake case. The reason that is, is SQL does not care about casing.\n",
            "[07:14.000 --> 07:23.000]  So this is the same thing. It's going to do the same operation. Me lowercase and create had no effect on it.\n",
            "[07:23.000 --> 07:30.000]  But you write code for other people, and it's important to structure things in a way that makes it easy to read.\n",
            "[07:30.000 --> 07:39.000]  So here, by uppercasing everything that's a keyword, it becomes very, very clear what is baked into Postgres itself and what is something that I'm naming.\n",
            "[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  What is something that I have control over? So here, this this profile name, this is a name I'm giving.\n",
            "[07:46.000 --> 07:54.000]  It could be anything I want virtually. I could call this person. I could call this user.\n",
            "[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  But for now, we may call it profile. I want to come back to that user point.\n",
            "[07:58.000 --> 08:06.000]  But that's the idea is that you're uppercasing all of the keywords and anything that is lowercase is something you're naming yourself.\n",
            "[08:06.000 --> 08:13.000]  So let's follow that to the next line. In fact, I'm going to skip over ID for a second because it's the most complex column we have.\n",
            "[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  We're going to talk about name next. So name here, that's, well, the name of the column.\n",
            "[08:18.000 --> 08:25.000]  I'm creating a column and I'm calling it name. And this is something to look out for the entirety of this video.\n",
            "[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  Anytime you see something that's lowercase, you should assume that is something that I'm naming.\n",
            "[08:30.000 --> 08:37.000]  It's not something that's built into Postgres itself. Next, we have this, which is a data type.\n",
            "[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  The data type is what constraints we're placing on this column itself.\n",
            "[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  And for me, this is what makes using relational databases so powerful.\n",
            "[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  You can add constraints to your columns. Data does not just exist in containers that have rules that are made up.\n",
            "[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  They are enforced by the database itself. I could not insert just a raw number into the name column if I wanted to.\n",
            "[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  And the reason is I'm telling Postgres here that this column is varchar 255. What is varchar?\n",
            "[09:10.000 --> 09:16.000]  That's a great question you might ask. This is the syntax for a comment. So I'm just, you know, I can write anything in here.\n",
            "[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  It doesn't matter. The editor ignores it. I'm just commenting on the column and it's good for taking notes.\n",
            "[09:22.000 --> 09:35.000]  So what I'm going to say here is varchar, and I'll uppercase it, is a text column that has a constraint on size.\n",
            "[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  And I know it's overflowing a little bit to the next line, but this is the same line.\n",
            "[09:39.000 --> 09:49.000]  So the idea here is that varchar is a text-based column, but critically it has a constraint on how long that text can be.\n",
            "[09:49.000 --> 09:59.000]  And the upper bounds for that is 255 characters. So the max we can do is varchar 255, but varchar 50 is valid as well.\n",
            "[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  And I think it's probably fine for me. It's pretty rare to have a name that's greater than 50 characters.\n",
            "[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  Maybe for covering all of our bases we'll do a 100 character name column.\n",
            "[10:09.000 --> 10:15.000]  So what this means is that this column is only going to take up enough space to show 100 characters.\n",
            "[10:15.000 --> 10:20.000]  And it's a great way to optimize your database so that you're not consuming more data than you need.\n",
            "[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  So here again we're saying that this name column is a text column and it can only max out at 100 characters.\n",
            "[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  For email it's the same thing. I'll leave 255. You can have some long emails. We'll leave 255.\n",
            "[10:33.000 --> 10:41.000]  And then password is just plain text. And the reason you would do that is that at least for applications I've worked on\n",
            "[10:41.000 --> 10:47.000]  in pretty much any app that you're ever going to touch actually, you're going to be hashing passwords in the database.\n",
            "[10:47.000 --> 10:58.000]  And password hashes can get pretty long depending on what hashing library you're using and what hashing algorithm you're using.\n",
            "[10:58.000 --> 11:04.000]  Whether you're using SHA or MD5. Anyways, that's not important for this talk.\n",
            "[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  The point is I'm making password text because placing constraints on something that's going to be hashed, it's kind of silly.\n",
            "[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  Next up we have age which is an integer. An integer is straightforward. It's a number itself.\n",
            "[11:18.000 --> 11:24.000]  So you're going to see numbers in here like 20 etc.\n",
            "[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  I want to note that there's a lot of different types for your columns.\n",
            "[11:29.000 --> 11:39.000]  And if you want an exhausted list of them, you can google Postgres column types and you'll get an extremely large list of all the different types.\n",
            "[11:39.000 --> 11:45.000]  One of those such types is serial. Serial is a special type because it sets up some additional stuff for us.\n",
            "[11:45.000 --> 11:50.000]  Some additional stuff that I'll dive into more in a future advanced Postgres tutorial.\n",
            "[11:50.000 --> 12:02.000]  But for now, the way I want you to think of this column is this column is an integer that automatically adds one for us.\n",
            "[12:02.000 --> 12:10.000]  Every new entity. So every single time we insert into this table, it will automatically add one to the ID column.\n",
            "[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  And what I mean by that is our first profile that we insert, the ID will be one. It starts at one with a serial column.\n",
            "[12:18.000 --> 12:24.000]  Then the next one, we don't have to do anything. It'll just automatically get the ID of two.\n",
            "[12:24.000 --> 12:30.000]  The ID column is something you never want to edit yourself. You want to let the database handle this.\n",
            "[12:30.000 --> 12:36.000]  When you're inserting profiles later, and we'll talk about this a bit more when we're actually inserting data momentarily,\n",
            "[12:36.000 --> 12:42.000]  but we want to avoid touching this column. This column is something we want the database to control.\n",
            "[12:42.000 --> 12:52.000]  The next part is the primary key. So primary key is just telling the database that this is the key that we're using to represent each row in the table.\n",
            "[12:52.000 --> 13:00.000]  And critically, that also means that it's going to be unique. We shouldn't have multiple profiles that have the same ID.\n",
            "[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  It's a unique identifier that we can then use later on to reference for specific rows. It's incredibly useful.\n",
            "[13:07.000 --> 13:12.000]  And we'll show that more as we get later into the crash course.\n",
            "[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  So again, serial is a data type. It's an integer that automatically does plus one every time.\n",
            "[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  So without further ado, let's go ahead and execute this statement.\n",
            "[13:23.000 --> 13:28.000]  So it worked. That's what this create table is. And I can show you it worked because Postico is awesome.\n",
            "[13:28.000 --> 13:35.000]  And if we come back here to the lecture DB and we hit this refresh icon at the top, you'll notice that there is this profile table here.\n",
            "[13:35.000 --> 13:40.000]  And if we click into it, we're seeing ID, name, email, password and age. Sorry if that's a bit small.\n",
            "[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  I tried to increase the font up there, but I couldn't. But that's our table. It's there. It does exist.\n",
            "[13:47.000 --> 13:54.000]  But you might be saying, Troy, in it seems kind of weird to call it a profile.\n",
            "[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  This seems like this table should probably be called user. Well, if we run this, it's going to fail.\n",
            "[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  And we're getting syntax error at or near user. That's a bit strange.\n",
            "[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  Think for a minute why that might happen. And you might get a bit hint, a bit of a hint by the coloring here.\n",
            "[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  So pause the video if you want a second to just think about why that could happen. All right.\n",
            "[14:19.000 --> 14:30.000]  Here's why. This is a keyword. So creating a table that's called table wouldn't work, because like I said at the start.\n",
            "[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  SQL doesn't care about casing. So when it sees this lowercase table, it's treating it the same as the uppercase one.\n",
            "[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  And it thinks that it's a keyword. So it's seeing some syntax error. It's like, hey, you're using a keyword here.\n",
            "[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  We're expecting a name. There's an easy way to omit this.\n",
            "[14:46.000 --> 14:51.000]  Whenever you're trying to name something in SQL or reference something that is not a keyword,\n",
            "[14:51.000 --> 14:59.000]  but happens to share the same name as one, you can wrap it in very specifically double quotes so we can say user.\n",
            "[14:59.000 --> 15:07.000]  Now this works and we get a user table. So if we refresh, we'll see the user table.\n",
            "[15:07.000 --> 15:15.000]  One last note on tables before we move on. You'll notice I'm calling it the user table, not users.\n",
            "[15:15.000 --> 15:23.000]  The reason for this is that the convention that you'll often see in Postgres is that you name tables as singular items.\n",
            "[15:23.000 --> 15:29.000]  And the thought behind that is that you think about tables as this bag that you put things in.\n",
            "[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  And because of that, when you're talking about it, it's really useful to think of it as a user table.\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:43.000]  It's a bag to contain things. So you wouldn't say you have a bag of candy, not you have bags of candy, unless you have multiple.\n",
            "[15:43.000 --> 15:50.000]  So that's the thought process. And I've seen it broken. I've worked at companies before that pluralized tables.\n",
            "[15:50.000 --> 15:55.000]  It doesn't really matter. It's not going to make a big difference on your software itself.\n",
            "[15:55.000 --> 16:02.000]  But there are times when you'll have tools that automatically generate things for you based off of your table names.\n",
            "[16:02.000 --> 16:10.000]  Rails and Ruby are a great example of that. Rails will automatically generate a lot of code for you as long as you follow good conventions.\n",
            "[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  And the other thing is it's a convention. It's what other developers will be expecting from your work.\n",
            "[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  So I think it's important to keep them singular whenever possible.\n",
            "[16:20.000 --> 16:28.000]  And if you ever work with or for me, you know, and I see a pluralized table in your code, I'm going to come at you a little bit.\n",
            "[16:28.000 --> 16:35.000]  You're going to have to be prepared for me to shoot down your code review and tell you you need to go change that.\n",
            "[16:35.000 --> 16:41.000]  OK, great. So we've got our user and profile in place. We're going to go ahead and drop the profile table.\n",
            "[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  This is really, really easy in post. You can just right click and delete.\n",
            "[16:46.000 --> 16:54.000]  And delete. And it's gone. In order to do that in SQL, you can just say drop table and then the table name.\n",
            "[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  But we have an editor. I would recommend using an editor, especially as you're getting started with SQL.\n",
            "[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  And I think Postico is a great option. OK, we've got our table in place.\n",
            "[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  We're very excited about that. Now we just need to get data inside.\n",
            "[17:09.000 --> 17:15.000]  We're going to learn some new ones here. We're going to say insert into our table name, which is user.\n",
            "[17:15.000 --> 17:22.000]  And remember, user here happens to also be a keyword. So we're going to wrap it in double quotes.\n",
            "[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  Then in parentheses, we specify what columns we want to insert.\n",
            "[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  Well, those columns are email, name, age and password.\n",
            "[17:33.000 --> 17:41.000]  You might be asking yourself or thinking, why is it ID here? We surely want an ID for each user.\n",
            "[17:41.000 --> 17:48.000]  Well, if you remember back to when we were talking about creating a table, the ID is of data type serial.\n",
            "[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  What that means is it's going to automatically generate an integer ID for us every new row.\n",
            "[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  So we don't have to insert it ourselves. In fact, it would be a mistake to.\n",
            "[17:58.000 --> 18:07.000]  This user that we insert will automatically have the ID of one for us because of Postgres's serial data type.\n",
            "[18:07.000 --> 18:11.000]  Let's go ahead and move on with the query. So we've got insert into user.\n",
            "[18:11.000 --> 18:19.000]  The columns were inserting email, name, age and password. And then we say the values, which is a keyword.\n",
            "[18:19.000 --> 18:23.000]  And now we can start to enter those values and how this works.\n",
            "[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  Is within these parentheses, we go in the same order that the columns are listed in these.\n",
            "[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  So the order here doesn't matter. We can order this however we want.\n",
            "[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  We just need to make sure we follow the order order after the values keyword.\n",
            "[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  So within here. So what that means is email needs to come first here when we're entering the value.\n",
            "[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  Name second, age third and password fourth.\n",
            "[18:45.000 --> 18:52.000]  So for email, I'm going to go ahead and enter Troy at fake email.\n",
            "[18:52.000 --> 19:03.000]  For name, I'm going to enter Troy. For age, I'll enter 26. And for password, I'll enter some nonsense.\n",
            "[19:03.000 --> 19:08.000]  OK, this is great. We've got our values in place. And if we run this, it should work.\n",
            "[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  But you might have a question. What are these single quotes doing here?\n",
            "[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  Well, single quotes are how we tell SQL that we're entering some text.\n",
            "[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  So this is just looked at by SQL as text. It's not read as if it was part of the code itself.\n",
            "[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  So if we put some SQL in here, this would get inserted as the actual email.\n",
            "[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  Sorry, let me use something you're familiar with. We haven't gotten to create statements or to select statements yet.\n",
            "[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  I'm getting ahead of myself. If we put like create table in here, this will get inserted as the email, right?\n",
            "[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  It's not going to look at this as code. It looks at it as text. And in fact, without it, it will look at it as code.\n",
            "[19:50.000 --> 20:00.000]  So if I omit those single quotes, it will read this and we'll get a syntax error because it doesn't know what Troy at fake email is.\n",
            "[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  We need the single quotes to tell it that this is a string value.\n",
            "[20:04.000 --> 20:11.000]  It's also important to call out if you've done other programming languages before, which if you're looking at in this course, you probably have.\n",
            "[20:11.000 --> 20:19.000]  Single quotes and double quotes are not the same here, which they are in a lot of programming languages like JavaScript, for example.\n",
            "[20:19.000 --> 20:25.000]  And double quotes here are specifically for referencing columns and tables.\n",
            "[20:25.000 --> 20:30.000]  And whenever you use them, SQL will expect you to be referencing one as such.\n",
            "[20:30.000 --> 20:36.000]  And the same with single quotes. If we swap these two and it's double quotes here and single quotes here, we're going to get a syntax error.\n",
            "[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  It's important to recognize the difference between those two.\n",
            "[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  Ages and integer. Integers are not text based data. They're not a string.\n",
            "[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  So we can just put it, you know, in line here. We don't need to wrap it in anything.\n",
            "[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  OK, fantastic. Let's execute that statement.\n",
            "[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  We say we've inserted and if we come back and look at our table here and refresh, you will notice.\n",
            "[21:00.000 --> 21:07.000]  And I know it's a bit hard to see. I'm sorry about that. But the tables there and all of our information is in there correctly.\n",
            "[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  This is great. I'm really, really happy that that worked.\n",
            "[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  And in fact, let's go ahead and insert another user just for practice sake.\n",
            "[21:15.000 --> 21:23.000]  OK, I'm going to insert another user. We're going to make it Chris at another dot example.\n",
            "[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  The person's name is going to be you're never going to believe it is Chris.\n",
            "[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  He's a notorious 98 year old man who's using our application and his password is.\n",
            "[21:33.000 --> 21:40.000]  Wow, I love SQL 28. And we'll go ahead and insert Chris.\n",
            "[21:40.000 --> 21:47.000]  It does work. And we can come back and look at our user table. And sure enough, he's along with Troy now.\n",
            "[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  All right. That's great news. We've got two rows in there now.\n",
            "[21:52.000 --> 21:57.000]  You might be thinking about something and I hope you are.\n",
            "[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  What do you do if you don't have a nice editor like this?\n",
            "[22:00.000 --> 22:08.000]  How do you get information out? And in fact, what is this editor maybe doing under the hood to show us this data?\n",
            "[22:08.000 --> 22:15.000]  Well, friends, that's what we're going to talk about next. And it leads us to some more keywords.\n",
            "[22:15.000 --> 22:21.000]  The next keyword that we unlock in our journey to SQL mastery is going to be select.\n",
            "[22:21.000 --> 22:27.000]  Select is a keyword that allows us to fetch information from existing tables.\n",
            "[22:27.000 --> 22:35.000]  It's what Postico is using under the hood to show us our entries when we go and we click on the user table here.\n",
            "[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  This is how it's grabbing information.\n",
            "[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  And remember, you're not always going to have access to a nice editor like this.\n",
            "[22:42.000 --> 22:50.000]  And also select gives us additional tools that make it even better sometimes than just viewing the data in an editor.\n",
            "[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  And we'll show you that more later on in the video.\n",
            "[22:53.000 --> 22:58.000]  But let's cover the basics for now, which, of course, starts with the select keyword.\n",
            "[22:58.000 --> 23:08.000]  So I'm going to go ahead and write out a basic select statement and then we'll break it down.\n",
            "[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  All right. Fantastic. Select star from user and let's run it.\n",
            "[23:13.000 --> 23:20.000]  And we can see here in the bottom, this is our SQL output that those rows show up in the user table.\n",
            "[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  The user table is there. I want you to think for a moment.\n",
            "[23:24.000 --> 23:30.000]  What does this star probably mean? You can probably easily infer what from means.\n",
            "[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  Select is clearly a keyword that's initiating the statement.\n",
            "[23:34.000 --> 23:40.000]  What do you think this star means? Pause the video here and contemplate with yourself.\n",
            "[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  So when I taught, most students would assume that it meant all rows.\n",
            "[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  It doesn't. It means all columns.\n",
            "[23:48.000 --> 23:55.000]  So this star is referring to what columns you want from user and star means all.\n",
            "[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  I can say I just want the name. And when we run this, we're only going to see Troy and Chris here.\n",
            "[24:01.000 --> 24:06.000]  It's only giving me the name back. I can say I just want the email and it's only going to give me the email.\n",
            "[24:06.000 --> 24:13.000]  Or I can do some combination. Give me the ID, the email and the name.\n",
            "[24:13.000 --> 24:18.000]  And there you go. Fantastic.\n",
            "[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  That brings up a question. We'll go back to select star so we can see everything.\n",
            "[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  How do we say that we only want specific entries? And it's a good question.\n",
            "[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  The way we do this is with the where keyword.\n",
            "[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  We can say select all columns from the user table where and then some condition.\n",
            "[24:38.000 --> 24:46.000]  So my condition might be where the name is Troy.\n",
            "[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  And if we run this, we're only going to see that single Troy row.\n",
            "[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  We can do this with any combination of different conditions.\n",
            "[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  So I could also say maybe get me all the users where the age is greater than 20.\n",
            "[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  We'll see both of our users in that case.\n",
            "[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  But if we change this to 27, we're only going to see Chris.\n",
            "[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  There's a lot of different conditions that you can use with a where statement.\n",
            "[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  I would encourage you to look up a more exhaustive list than I'm able to go through here.\n",
            "[25:18.000 --> 25:26.000]  But it's extremely powerful and it's our way where we can specify specifically what rows we want to see.\n",
            "[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  And then later on when we're talking about update and delete statements, where statements become critical.\n",
            "[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  Because it allows us to specify what rows we want to specifically affect from our queries.\n",
            "[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  All right. So we've got data in. We're able to select it.\n",
            "[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  We're able to say, you know, give me the user with the ID of one. Give me the user with the ID of two.\n",
            "[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  We have that power now. The next thing we need to learn is how do we change data?\n",
            "[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  We've got these users in place. What happens when we made a mistake?\n",
            "[25:58.000 --> 26:03.000]  Troy is not 26. He's 30. And we need to update that user. How do we do that?\n",
            "[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  All right. So we've just unlocked our ability to select information. Now we need to be able to change it.\n",
            "[26:09.000 --> 26:18.000]  So like I mentioned, we want to be able to change this row from age 26 to age 30.\n",
            "[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  How do we do that? Well, in order to do it, we're yet again going to need some new keywords.\n",
            "[26:23.000 --> 26:33.000]  Those keywords are update and set. So the way we construct an update statement is we initiate it off with the update keyword.\n",
            "[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  And then we tell it what table we're going to be updating. In our case, that's the user table.\n",
            "[26:38.000 --> 26:46.000]  Then we say what we would like to change. I'm going to say set the age equal to 30.\n",
            "[26:46.000 --> 26:53.000]  OK, so we're saying update user set age equal to 30 where and then we use that where statement again.\n",
            "[26:53.000 --> 26:58.000]  Remember it from select. This is how we drill down into it without this.\n",
            "[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  If I was to just say set age to 30, it would update every user.\n",
            "[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  Any time you're writing an update statement and then later on, I'll reiterate for deletes.\n",
            "[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  We need to make sure that we're specifying a condition or we're going to make that update to everything.\n",
            "[27:13.000 --> 27:19.000]  It's a really, really good way to have some embarrassing conversations in your first engineering job.\n",
            "[27:19.000 --> 27:25.000]  So let's make sure we're using our where condition. We'll say where the ID is one.\n",
            "[27:25.000 --> 27:33.000]  So this is our condition. We're saying update the user table, set the age to be 30, where the ID is currently one.\n",
            "[27:33.000 --> 27:44.000]  And then the update went through. Let's use our new skill and let's select star from user where ID is one.\n",
            "[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  And again, we have to wrap this in double quotes.\n",
            "[27:49.000 --> 27:54.000]  And then we'll go ahead and we'll remove this statement for now. We'll come back and revisit it.\n",
            "[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  But let's just see if we've got the update going through and we did. His age is now 30. That's awesome.\n",
            "[27:59.000 --> 28:06.000]  It worked. All right, great. So that's the basics for update statements.\n",
            "[28:06.000 --> 28:14.000]  I want to make one additional note, and it's about this equal operator, the equal operator, as well as a lot of operators in SQL.\n",
            "[28:14.000 --> 28:22.000]  They change based off of the context in which you use them. This one here is being used to construct a condition because it's prefaced by a where statement.\n",
            "[28:22.000 --> 28:27.000]  This one here is being used to assign a value, and that's because it's prefaced by a set.\n",
            "[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  It's important to distinct or to separate those two in your mind.\n",
            "[28:31.000 --> 28:38.000]  And remember that the equal sign operator changes based off of the context in which it's being used.\n",
            "[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  OK, great. That's the basics of update statements. We could use this to update any of the columns, really.\n",
            "[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  But again, we want to avoid updating the ID.\n",
            "[28:46.000 --> 28:58.000]  But maybe just for the sake of another example, maybe we go ahead and we update the email of that same user to be Troy at test dot fake.\n",
            "[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  And these are obviously fake emails, but we go ahead and update that and then, you know, select.\n",
            "[29:05.000 --> 29:11.000]  Maybe I just want to see the email from user where.\n",
            "[29:11.000 --> 29:17.000]  ID is one. And there you go. The email has been updated.\n",
            "[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  That's fantastic. So we've learned how to do almost all of the basic operations.\n",
            "[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  There's just one more left, and that's removing information. What happens when we have a user that we want to delete?\n",
            "[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  Right. This is an applications database. We might want to remove users, allow them to delete their account entirely.\n",
            "[29:35.000 --> 29:43.000]  How would we do that in SQL? Well, the way we do that is with the lead statements and they start with a new keyword.\n",
            "[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  You say delete and we say what table it's from. We'll specify user.\n",
            "[29:48.000 --> 29:53.000]  And then another call out here. Don't run this query. The old table is gone.\n",
            "[29:53.000 --> 29:59.000]  If we run this query, we need a where condition, just like we needed with the update query.\n",
            "[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  We're going to delete from user where the ID equals two.\n",
            "[30:03.000 --> 30:08.000]  Maybe our 98 year old friend Chris is done using the application. We got to get rid of them.\n",
            "[30:08.000 --> 30:13.000]  So we'll go ahead and delete them again. Don't run. Just delete from user in isolation.\n",
            "[30:13.000 --> 30:19.000]  Make sure you're specifying the condition so it knows what to delete.\n",
            "[30:19.000 --> 30:25.000]  So we've gone ahead and deleted that user. And if we go and we select all from user.\n",
            "[30:25.000 --> 30:32.000]  So we'll get all the users. We're going to see. Sure enough, there's only one user left.\n",
            "[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  And that's Troy. All right. That's the basic operations with that.\n",
            "[30:37.000 --> 30:43.000]  You can do full crud, create, read, update, delete operations on any table of your choosing.\n",
            "[30:43.000 --> 30:51.000]  That's the basics, the building blocks of SQL. But now we need to talk about something just a shred more advanced.\n",
            "[30:51.000 --> 30:57.000]  And that's that data does not live alone. Data is related to one another, right?\n",
            "[30:57.000 --> 31:03.000]  You don't just have users in your application. And for our application, we're going to also have posts.\n",
            "[31:03.000 --> 31:09.000]  Let's talk about how to relate information together in SQL. I brought you back to everyone's favorite realm.\n",
            "[31:09.000 --> 31:14.000]  It's the PowerPoint realm. And we're going to talk about table relationships.\n",
            "[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  So tables can have relationships with other tables. And I'm not talking about the bachelor type.\n",
            "[31:19.000 --> 31:25.000]  I'm talking about data relating to another piece of data.\n",
            "[31:25.000 --> 31:32.000]  So information in our applications does not live alone. Things have relationships with one another.\n",
            "[31:32.000 --> 31:37.000]  If you think about the site you're on right now, YouTube, each of these videos have comments.\n",
            "[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  How does that relationship work? How do we relate those things together?\n",
            "[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  Well, the way we relate those together is through foreign keys.\n",
            "[31:46.000 --> 31:54.000]  And those foreign keys allow us to reference specific entities in another table from a table.\n",
            "[31:54.000 --> 31:58.000]  So I'll show you exactly what I mean with one of these examples here.\n",
            "[31:58.000 --> 32:04.000]  Let's go ahead and look at our user post example. That one is actually a bit covered up by me.\n",
            "[32:04.000 --> 32:07.000]  OK, let's look at the Avodart example here.\n",
            "[32:07.000 --> 32:11.000]  So the user table here, and this is just real quick, I want to touch on what this is.\n",
            "[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  This is what we would call an entity relationship diagram.\n",
            "[32:14.000 --> 32:20.000]  So it's showcasing from a high level how our tables are laid out and related.\n",
            "[32:20.000 --> 32:25.000]  So here we have that user table that we made, but you'll notice we've added something new.\n",
            "[32:25.000 --> 32:33.000]  It's the avatar ID. That avatar ID is referencing a row, an entity in the avatar table.\n",
            "[32:33.000 --> 32:41.000]  It's a new table. And then the avatar itself has a user ID that's referencing back to this user's ID.\n",
            "[32:41.000 --> 32:48.000]  So it's related in that manner. Basically, what that means is that each new user might have an avatar ID.\n",
            "[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  So say we have that user one. It's Troy. We all know and love him.\n",
            "[32:52.000 --> 32:59.000]  He's got the avatar ID three. What that tells SQL is that if you go over to that avatar table\n",
            "[32:59.000 --> 33:07.000]  and you look for the avatar where the ID is equal to three, you will find Troy's avatar.\n",
            "[33:07.000 --> 33:14.000]  That kind of relationship where a user has one avatar and each avatar belongs to one user,\n",
            "[33:14.000 --> 33:17.000]  that's called a one to one relationship.\n",
            "[33:17.000 --> 33:22.000]  There's three different relationship types when we're using relational databases.\n",
            "[33:22.000 --> 33:30.000]  There's a one to one like this user and avatar relationship where one user has one avatar and one avatar belongs to one user.\n",
            "[33:30.000 --> 33:33.000]  Then there's one to many. And this is the most common type.\n",
            "[33:33.000 --> 33:41.000]  And it's the example we'll be using in our code. One to many is when one entity has multiple of another entity.\n",
            "[33:41.000 --> 33:49.000]  A great example is users and posts. Another good example is the YouTube video we have and comments.\n",
            "[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  A YouTube video has multiple comments. So you might imagine that in YouTube's internal system,\n",
            "[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  they have a video table and then that video table, you know, exists with no foreign key.\n",
            "[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  And then there's this other separate comments table that has video IDs on each one.\n",
            "[34:09.000 --> 34:17.000]  We'll break those down more in further slides. Let's jump in and talk about each one of the three relationship types in depth.\n",
            "[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  The final ones, many to many, we'll get there. We'll get there. I know it's on the bullet point.\n",
            "[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  I don't want to make anyone nervous. I just don't have a photo for it.\n",
            "[34:23.000 --> 34:29.000]  Let's talk about one to one. One to one is the easiest type of relationship to wrap your head around.\n",
            "[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  A user here has an avatar ID, an avatar has a user ID.\n",
            "[34:33.000 --> 34:41.000]  So each row in the user table will have an ID referencing a very specific entity in the avatar table.\n",
            "[34:41.000 --> 34:45.000]  We talked about this on the last slide, but let's reiterate again. Say you have Troy.\n",
            "[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  He's got the idea of one we all know and love. We made him ourself.\n",
            "[34:48.000 --> 35:00.000]  He's now got an avatar ID. That avatar ID references the row in the avatar table in which you will find Troy's avatar.\n",
            "[35:00.000 --> 35:08.000]  So if Troy has the avatar ID three, we would go to the avatar table and look for, you know, maybe you write a select statement,\n",
            "[35:08.000 --> 35:16.000]  select for the avatar where the avatar ID is three, and then you'll see Troy's avatar is sitting there.\n",
            "[35:16.000 --> 35:22.000]  And just the same in reverse. That's the critical part here is that the avatar also has the user ID, right?\n",
            "[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  That user ID is referencing back to Troy. That's what makes it a one to one.\n",
            "[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  I want to note that although this example is one of the easiest to go through,\n",
            "[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  one to one relationships are an easy thing to wrap your head around.\n",
            "[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  They're actually the least useful and it's something you won't see a ton.\n",
            "[35:38.000 --> 35:43.000]  Oftentimes they're used to just avoid column bloat, which is when a table gets out of hand,\n",
            "[35:43.000 --> 35:47.000]  because over time you're continuously adding more and more things to an application.\n",
            "[35:47.000 --> 35:55.000]  So oftentimes you'll see it to just avoid bloating the size of your tables by spreading out information across multiple.\n",
            "[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  The next type of relationship is a one to many. One to many relationships are the most common one you're going to see.\n",
            "[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  And in fact, the next relationship we look at, which is a many to many, is just actually two one to minis.\n",
            "[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk about one to many.\n",
            "[36:12.000 --> 36:20.000]  So one to many is when one entity has many of another entities, or they can potentially have many of another entities.\n",
            "[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  And let's talk about that example a bit more in the context of YouTube in this video.\n",
            "[36:24.000 --> 36:30.000]  This video has multiple comments, right? But it doesn't need to have multiple comments.\n",
            "[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  In fact, when you're watching this right now, it might not have any comments. And that's the case.\n",
            "[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  You could be the first one, please. But anyways, the point is the entity, which is the video in YouTube's case,\n",
            "[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  has the potential to have multiple comments, even if it doesn't yet.\n",
            "[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  And the way that we set that up is through a one to many relationship.\n",
            "[36:50.000 --> 36:55.000]  Let's jump back to thinking about our specific example, which is a user and a post.\n",
            "[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  A user has multiple posts. And the way we set that up is we keep our user table as is.\n",
            "[37:01.000 --> 37:10.000]  You'll notice it's the same. It's unchanged. But now we've created this post table and the post table has the user ID.\n",
            "[37:10.000 --> 37:15.000]  In a one to many relationship, it's up to the many to say who owns it.\n",
            "[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  Right. Each entity of that post will tell us who owns that user.\n",
            "[37:20.000 --> 37:29.000]  And the reason is we can't put a post ID on a user because that would mean that each user can only have one post,\n",
            "[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  which isn't the case. The user cannot reference posts. The post needs to reference the user.\n",
            "[37:35.000 --> 37:43.000]  When we dive into actually making this post table, I'll reiterate that and elaborate just a hair more to make sure you wrap your head around it.\n",
            "[37:43.000 --> 37:50.000]  But in relationships, the many references the one, not the other way around.\n",
            "[37:50.000 --> 37:56.000]  And again, the reason is that would constrain the user to only being able to have one thing.\n",
            "[37:56.000 --> 38:04.000]  Because if you think about it, each of these posts has a user ID. That user ID can only exist once per post.\n",
            "[38:04.000 --> 38:09.000]  So the post belongs to the user. If we invert that and the user has a post ID,\n",
            "[38:09.000 --> 38:15.000]  that would mean the user could only have one post just like they can only have one name.\n",
            "[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  But they don't. They don't have a post ID here.\n",
            "[38:17.000 --> 38:27.000]  And that that omitting of that column allows the user to have multiple posts through this post table.\n",
            "[38:27.000 --> 38:31.000]  Let's talk about the final relationship, which is a many to many.\n",
            "[38:31.000 --> 38:35.000]  This one is a bit more complex and in complicated schemas, you'll see it a lot.\n",
            "[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  But don't freak out. Don't freak out that we have three tables now.\n",
            "[38:39.000 --> 38:48.000]  All we want to focus on here is that if you look at these tables in isolation, they're actually just two one to manys, which you're comfortable with.\n",
            "[38:48.000 --> 38:55.000]  So all a many to many is it relates two separate tables to each other through one center table.\n",
            "[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  And we typically call that table a join table.\n",
            "[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  So we've got a one to many over here and another one to many over here.\n",
            "[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  Those are related together through a join table.\n",
            "[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  The best example I could think of for this was a school set up.\n",
            "[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  So you have in a school students or users that are taking classes from instructors.\n",
            "[39:17.000 --> 39:22.000]  An instructor has multiple students and the student will have multiple instructors.\n",
            "[39:22.000 --> 39:27.000]  So how do we relate that stuff together? Well, we relate them together through the class.\n",
            "[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  Right. So we have a user.\n",
            "[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  A user has a class here. This class, as such, has the user ID.\n",
            "[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  Remember, the user has nothing about the class because it owns the class.\n",
            "[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  The class is the one who references the owner.\n",
            "[39:42.000 --> 39:49.000]  Now, that instructor is also teaching the class. So as such, they have their instructor ID on the class.\n",
            "[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  And you'll notice that these are two separate one to many relationships.\n",
            "[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  But through them, we have the ability for a user to have multiple classes.\n",
            "[39:57.000 --> 40:01.000]  And then each of those classes could have different instructors.\n",
            "[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  And because of that, you could say that a user has many instructors through this class table.\n",
            "[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  And that's true in inverse as well.\n",
            "[40:10.000 --> 40:18.000]  OK, we're back in post to go world and we're ready to create our post table.\n",
            "[40:18.000 --> 40:22.000]  So let's go ahead and start with create table. You guys know this now.\n",
            "[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  We're going to create the post table.\n",
            "[40:24.000 --> 40:30.000]  Think about why I don't have to wrap this in quotes. Remember back to past in the lecture?\n",
            "[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  Why don't I have to wrap that in quotes? Make sure you know. Make sure you know why.\n",
            "[40:34.000 --> 40:42.000]  I'm going to create the table post. It's going to need, just like every table, an ID, which is a serial primary key.\n",
            "[40:42.000 --> 40:47.000]  And then we're going to give it a name, a name for the post itself. Maybe this is a varchar 255.\n",
            "[40:47.000 --> 40:51.000]  You're maxing out at 255 characters for the name.\n",
            "[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  Then content, which we can go ahead and make text.\n",
            "[40:55.000 --> 41:03.000]  And finally, that foreign key. What relates the post to the user is a user ID.\n",
            "[41:03.000 --> 41:10.000]  Each post will have the ID associated with the user that made said post.\n",
            "[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  And we'll go ahead and just make it an integer.\n",
            "[41:13.000 --> 41:21.000]  Next, what we need to do is we need to tell Postgres that this user ID is not just a normal integer.\n",
            "[41:21.000 --> 41:26.000]  It's a special integer. It's a foreign key. And the way we do that is by creating a constraint.\n",
            "[41:26.000 --> 41:33.000]  We can come and say constraint. Constraint. I can type. I can text.\n",
            "[41:33.000 --> 41:40.000]  Constraint. And then we give the constraint a name. I'll call it FK user, which is just a convention.\n",
            "[41:40.000 --> 41:49.000]  It means foreign key for the user. Then we can say it's a foreign key.\n",
            "[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  Then we tell it what column the foreign key belongs to, which in our case is the user ID.\n",
            "[41:55.000 --> 42:05.000]  Next, we tell it what that column is referencing. Well, it references the user ID column.\n",
            "[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  And now this here is referencing the table. So we'll say user and ID.\n",
            "[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  So again, at the end of our create table, we're creating a constraint.\n",
            "[42:15.000 --> 42:21.000]  The constraint is that we have a foreign key. The foreign key here is what column we're talking about.\n",
            "[42:21.000 --> 42:30.000]  The user ID. And then we tell it what that foreign key is for. It's referencing the user table ID column.\n",
            "[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  So we're saying this user ID column in the post table is referencing the ID column in the user table.\n",
            "[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  We'll go ahead and execute that statement and our table is made.\n",
            "[42:42.000 --> 42:48.000]  If we go ahead and refresh post to go here, we'll see now that that post table is there.\n",
            "[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  And if we look, it has this nice structure tab for us just for us to confirm that it worked.\n",
            "[42:54.000 --> 43:01.000]  We'll see user ID and I know it might be a bit small, but here it has a constraint where it's referencing.\n",
            "[43:01.000 --> 43:09.000]  It's got this arrow to user ID. It's a foreign key. We've got it separate or we've got it set up properly.\n",
            "[43:09.000 --> 43:15.000]  OK, we made our table with the foreign key. Let's go ahead and insert into this table.\n",
            "[43:15.000 --> 43:22.000]  So we could just write an insert. But remember, we have a constraint. Each post needs to belong to a user.\n",
            "[43:22.000 --> 43:28.000]  So let's just quickly review what users we have in our table.\n",
            "[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  And excuse me, I have to wrap that in double quotes. And there we go.\n",
            "[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  We have just the one and they've got the ID of one. So let's remember that we're inserting for ID one.\n",
            "[43:37.000 --> 43:43.000]  So we'll go ahead and construct our post insert now. We'll do insert into post.\n",
            "[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  And again, we don't have to wrap this in double quotes. You guys know that.\n",
            "[43:47.000 --> 43:53.000]  The values we'll insert are the name and the content and the user ID.\n",
            "[43:53.000 --> 44:03.000]  And we say the values. Maybe this post is why I love corgis.\n",
            "[44:03.000 --> 44:11.000]  The content is, oh my God, I love them. And the user who made them was user one.\n",
            "[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  He's a big corgi fan. We can go ahead and insert them.\n",
            "[44:16.000 --> 44:30.000]  And then if we look at the post table, we're going to see, sure enough, the corgi post is there.\n",
            "[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  Now, let's go ahead and insert some more. So we'll bring back.\n",
            "[44:33.000 --> 44:40.000]  I just undid a bit to get back to the insert post. Excuse me there.\n",
            "[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  So we're inserting the post. Why I love corgis. OMG, I love them.\n",
            "[44:44.000 --> 44:50.000]  Let's just say why I love dogs in general. So much.\n",
            "[44:50.000 --> 44:57.000]  And it was also made by user one. What did I do wrong here?\n",
            "[44:57.000 --> 45:02.000]  Content, user ID. OMG, why I love them so much.\n",
            "[45:02.000 --> 45:05.000]  I don't see. I don't see it. Do you guys see it?\n",
            "[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  Do you guys see where I made my mistake?\n",
            "[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  I love them in general. Oh, oh, oh, oh my goodness. Something good.\n",
            "[45:19.000 --> 45:22.000]  This is a good call out. Something good to know about Postico.\n",
            "[45:22.000 --> 45:26.000]  Is that if you highlight something and hit execute selection, it's just going to execute that.\n",
            "[45:26.000 --> 45:31.000]  We want to execute the whole statement. I'm not going insane. This is correct.\n",
            "[45:31.000 --> 45:39.000]  Okay, we inserted the post now. So if we go back and we say select star from post.\n",
            "[45:39.000 --> 45:47.000]  And end it with a semicolon. There we go. We've got these two posts in place.\n",
            "[45:47.000 --> 45:53.000]  Okay, perfect. So we've got our two posts in place. That's great.\n",
            "[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  And we can see that those both belong to user one.\n",
            "[45:56.000 --> 46:01.000]  And that's how we get that one to many, right? This user one has many posts.\n",
            "[46:01.000 --> 46:06.000]  Because we've got two separate posts with the user ID one. It works.\n",
            "[46:06.000 --> 46:12.000]  Now the question is, how do we say I want the user along with their posts?\n",
            "[46:12.000 --> 46:17.000]  That seems like an interesting piece of data to retrieve.\n",
            "[46:17.000 --> 46:24.000]  The way that we select data from multiple tables is by leveraging a join.\n",
            "[46:24.000 --> 46:30.000]  Now there's multiple types of joins. There's an inner join, an outer join, a left join, and a right join.\n",
            "[46:30.000 --> 46:36.000]  But diving into them super thoroughly is probably a good topic for a future Postgres video.\n",
            "[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  Because we're just trying to talk about the basics. And for now, let's just talk about inner joins.\n",
            "[46:42.000 --> 46:46.000]  So what we can do is we can start from the user table.\n",
            "[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  So we'll go from the user table. Select from user.\n",
            "[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  There we go. There's our user data.\n",
            "[46:53.000 --> 47:03.000]  And then what we can do is we can tell this table that it needs to also join to the posts table.\n",
            "[47:03.000 --> 47:08.000]  So I'm saying select from users table. Join it to the posts table.\n",
            "[47:08.000 --> 47:14.000]  So we're going to combine those two tables together. And then we need to tell it on what place does it join.\n",
            "[47:14.000 --> 47:26.000]  Well, it joins on where the posts table user ID is the same as the user ID.\n",
            "[47:26.000 --> 47:34.000]  So we've got these big tables. And what we're saying is wherever the posts table has a user ID,\n",
            "[47:34.000 --> 47:41.000]  that lines up with one of the IDs of a user, we're going to match those things together.\n",
            "[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  So what we'll see here is we'll see two rows because there's two separate posts.\n",
            "[47:46.000 --> 47:51.000]  But for each one, they've lined up with the user ID one.\n",
            "[47:51.000 --> 47:56.000]  Because we're joining wherever the posts user ID is, you know, the user ID.\n",
            "[47:56.000 --> 48:01.000]  So give me for a post like this first post. Let's talk about the second one.\n",
            "[48:01.000 --> 48:08.000]  Like the second post. Give me the user information where the user's ID, in this case one,\n",
            "[48:08.000 --> 48:14.000]  lines up with our post user ID column. And there we go. It lines up.\n",
            "[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  So there's our join. But you might notice something here.\n",
            "[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  We have two name columns, which is fine for us viewing it here.\n",
            "[48:22.000 --> 48:29.000]  But what if we're using this in an application and these become variables in some other programming language?\n",
            "[48:29.000 --> 48:33.000]  Well, you can't have variables with the same name in most languages.\n",
            "[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  So it's probably useful to know how we can reference these things differently.\n",
            "[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  Well, remember the star means select everything. And we can change it up a little bit.\n",
            "[48:44.000 --> 48:51.000]  We can say select everything from the user table.\n",
            "[48:51.000 --> 49:01.000]  So we'll say user star. But then maybe from the post table, we'll get the post ID, the post name.\n",
            "[49:01.000 --> 49:10.000]  But then we'll tell it to not call it post name. We'll say call it title as title.\n",
            "[49:10.000 --> 49:17.000]  Then we can say, get me the post content and get me the post user ID.\n",
            "[49:17.000 --> 49:23.000]  Now, what you'll notice is when we run this, it's the same data, but it's gone ahead and it's changed.\n",
            "[49:23.000 --> 49:28.000]  And it might be hard to see. But now the title of the poster,\n",
            "[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  I should say the name of the post is now called title. And that doesn't change anything in the table itself.\n",
            "[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's just changing the results we get back with our select statement.\n",
            "[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  So that covers the basics of joins. In future videos, we'll be talking about more complex joins,\n",
            "[49:45.000 --> 49:54.000]  more complex schema design, as well as triggers, Postgres functions and more complex constraints.\n",

            "[01:06.000 --> 01:16.000]  For starters, you need to know Python. You need to know the basics of Python, as well as object oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and so on.\n",
            "[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  You should also know the basics of relational databases, so you should be familiar with concepts such as tables,\n",
            "[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  columns, primary and foreign keys, relationships, and so on.\n",
            "[01:26.000 --> 01:33.000]  If you need to refresh the fundamentals, I have a couple of beginner level tutorials on my YouTube channel, as well as comprehensive courses on my website,\n",
            "[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  codewithmosh.com. I've put the links down below in case you're interested.\n",
            "[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  Alright, so I'm assuming that you're the right student for this course, now let's talk about how you should take this course.\n",
            "[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  First and foremost, I want you to watch this entire course all the way\n",
            "[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  from the beginning to the end, even if you're familiar with Django, because along the way\n",
            "[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  I will share a lot of tips and tricks and I don't want you to miss out on any of them.\n",

            "[02:02.000 --> 02:06.000]  with repetitive or useless stuff, so make sure to watch every lesson.\n",
            "[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  Now, while watching each lesson, I want you to take notes.\n",
            "[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  You can just write down some keywords on a piece of paper if you don't want to write a lot of notes.\n",
            "[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  I strongly believe that the act of writing things down will help you\n",
            "[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  remember new things that you learn. Then, after each lesson, go through\n",
            "[02:22.000 --> 02:26.000]  your notes and repeat the same steps I showed you in the video. This is exactly how\n",
            "[02:26.000 --> 02:30.000]  I personally learn new things. Also, I've carefully designed\n",
            "[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  tons of exercises that help you understand and remember the materials.\n",
            "[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  So make sure to do all these exercises, because the more you practice, the better you'll be\n",
            "[02:38.000 --> 02:42.000]  at Django or coding in general.\n",
            "[02:42.000 --> 02:46.000]  Welcome back to the Ultimate Django course. In this section,\n",
            "[02:46.000 --> 02:50.000]  we're going to talk about the basics of Django. First, I will give you a quick\n",
            "[02:50.000 --> 02:54.000]  introduction to what Django is and why it's so popular.\n",
            "[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  Then we'll talk about the fundamental web development concepts that every web\n",
            "[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  developer must know. Next, we'll set up our machine for development and\n",
            "[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  create our first Django project. Once that project is up and running,\n",
            "[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  I will show you two essential techniques for debugging Django applications.\n",
            "[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  This is going to be a short and sweet introduction to Django, so let's jump in and get started.\n",
            "[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  So what is Django and why is it so popular? Well, Django\n",
            "[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  is a free and open source framework for building web applications with\n",
            "[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  Python. It's not the only web framework for Python, but it's the most popular\n",
            "[03:34.000 --> 03:38.000]  one. Because it helps us build the website in less time with fewer\n",
            "[03:38.000 --> 03:42.000]  lines of code. That's why a lot of companies like YouTube, Instagram,\n",
            "[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  Spotify, and Dropbox use Django in their tech stack.\n",
            "[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  Now, Django is what we call a batteries included framework, which\n",
            "[03:50.000 --> 03:54.000]  means it comes with a lot of features out of the box so we don't have to\n",
            "[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  code them from scratch. For example, it gives us an admin interface for\n",
            "[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  managing our data which is a huge time saver, it also has an\n",
            "[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  object relational mapper that abstracts the database so we can query\n",
            "[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  or persist data without writing a lot of SQL code. It also comes\n",
            "[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  with an authentication package for identifying users, it also has a\n",
            "[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  package for caching data and much much more. So since Django\n",
            "[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  offers all these amazing features, we can focus on our application and its requirements.\n",
            "[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  We don't have to reinvent the wheel and code all these features from scratch.\n",
            "[04:26.000 --> 04:30.000]  Now, once in a while, you might come across someone like our popular\n",
            "[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  superstar developer, John Smith, who thinks Django is a piece of crap\n",
            "[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  because it's old and bloated with so many features. He used it, hated it,\n",
            "[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  and then rewrote his entire project with a new shiny framework that is\n",
            "[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  faster. Well, saying a framework is better than Django because it's faster\n",
            "[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  is kind of like saying a Ferrari is better than a truck because it's faster.\n",
            "[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  What if you want to move something? You're not going to use your Ferrari for that, right?\n",
            "[04:54.000 --> 04:58.000]  So a wise software engineer doesn't pick up a framework\n",
            "[04:58.000 --> 05:02.000]  merely based on its performance. There are so many other things you need to take into account\n",
            "[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  like the maturity of the framework, how stable it is from one version to another,\n",
            "[05:06.000 --> 05:10.000]  its learning curve, the size of the community and so on. Django\n",
            "[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  has been around for a long time and it has a huge community. So there are tons\n",
            "[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  of Django packages built by the community that you can reuse in your applications.\n",
            "[05:18.000 --> 05:22.000]  Also, if you get stuck, there's always someone out there to help you.\n",
            "[05:22.000 --> 05:26.000]  If you want to hire people, there are tons of people to choose from. So these are the benefits\n",
            "[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  of having a huge community around the framework. Now, regarding Django features,\n",
            "[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  yes, Django comes with a lot of features, but you don't have to use\n",
            "[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  or even learn all of them, because all these features are optional.\n",
            "[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  So you can use the features that make sense for your application. So in my opinion,\n",
            "[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  debates about the best framework in the world are useless. We all like\n",
            "[05:46.000 --> 05:50.000]  different things and just because someone doesn't like Django, it doesn't mean it's bad.\n",
            "[05:50.000 --> 05:54.000]  A lot of companies are using Django and are looking for Django developers.\n",
            "[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Here in the US, the average salary of a Django developer is just over\n",
            "[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  $117,000 a year. So if you like Python and\n",
            "[06:02.000 --> 06:06.000]  want to get into web development, learning Django is a good investment for your future.\n",
            "[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  So, you learned that Django is a framework for building web\n",
            "[06:16.000 --> 06:20.000]  applications with Python. Now let's talk about some of the fundamental\n",
            "[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  concepts you need to understand to build web applications. Let's say we're going to\n",
            "[06:24.000 --> 06:28.000]  build an online store and publish it at mosh buy.com. Now this\n",
            "[06:28.000 --> 06:32.000]  website is going to have two parts or two applications. A front\n",
            "[06:32.000 --> 06:36.000]  end and a back end. The front end is the part that is loaded\n",
            "[06:36.000 --> 06:40.000]  inside a web browser on a client machine. It's the part that the user sees\n",
            "[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  and interacts with. The back end is the part that runs on a web server\n",
            "[06:44.000 --> 06:48.000]  and is responsible for data processing, validating business\n",
            "[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  rules and so on. Now let's imagine that Alice wants to visit our website.\n",
            "[06:52.000 --> 06:56.000]  So, she points her browser to mosh buy.com. This address\n",
            "[06:56.000 --> 07:00.000]  is also called a URL, which is short for uniform resource\n",
            "[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  locator. It's basically a way to locate a resource on our internet.\n",
            "[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  A resource can be a web page, an image, a video, a PDF\n",
            "[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  and so on. So, Alice types mosh buy.com in her browser and\n",
            "[07:12.000 --> 07:16.000]  presses enter. At this moment, her browser sends a request to the web\n",
            "[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  server that hosts our website and says, hey, Alice wants to see the\n",
            "[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  home page. So, the web server should take this request, process it,\n",
            "[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  and return a response back to the client. This data exchange is\n",
            "[07:28.000 --> 07:32.000]  defined by a protocol called HTTP, which is short for hyper text\n",
            "[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  transfer protocol. It defines how clients and servers can communicate.\n",
            "[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  So this is the big picture. As Alice navigates our website,\n",
            "[07:40.000 --> 07:44.000]  for each page, her browser sends an HTTP request to the server\n",
            "[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  and receives an HTTP response. Now, as part of building the back end\n",
            "[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  for this website, we need to decide how we're going to respond to clients.\n",
            "[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  One option is to generate the requested page on the server and return it to the client.\n",
            "[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  We use HTML for that. HTML is short for hyper text\n",
            "[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  markup language. It's a simple language for representing web pages\n",
            "[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  on their content. Every web page we have seen on our internet is built using HTML.\n",
            "[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  So one option is to generate the page on the server and return\n",
            "[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  an HTML document to the client. The other option is to return\n",
            "[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  only the data needed on the requested page and have the client generate\n",
            "[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  the page. So, instead of putting a complete page or\n",
            "[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  a complete HTML document in an HTTP response, we only return\n",
            "[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  the data like the list of products. Now what is the difference?\n",
            "[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  Well, if we push this responsibility to the client, we can free up the server\n",
            "[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  so it can serve more clients. Our application will be more scalable.\n",
            "[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  That's why over the past few years this approach has become more trendy and\n",
            "[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  is now considered the industry best practice. These days we have tools like\n",
            "[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  React, Angular, and Vue for generating web pages on the client.\n",
            "[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  These are all client side tools that are used by front end developers. In contrast,\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  we have server side tools for building back ends. Django falls\n",
            "[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  in this category. So you should not compare Django with let's say React.\n",
            "[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  You may compare Django with other server side frameworks like\n",
            "[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  ASP.NET Core which is used by C sharp developers, Express used by\n",
            "[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  JavaScript developers and so on. So if we push the responsibility\n",
            "[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  of generating web pages to the client, the server essentially becomes\n",
            "[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  a gateway to the data. On the server, we can provide endpoints\n",
            "[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  that the client can talk to to get or save various pieces of data.\n",
            "[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  For example, we can provide one endpoint to get the list of products\n",
            "[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  and another endpoint to get the list of orders someone has placed.\n",
            "[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  Now all these endpoints together represent the interface that clients\n",
            "[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  use to talk to the server. In technical terms, we say the server\n",
            "[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  provides an API or an application programming interface to clients.\n",
            "[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  This API is essentially like the buttons on a remote control.\n",
            "[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  All these buttons together represent the interface or the API we use to\n",
            "[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  interact with the TV. Okay? So in this course, our focus will\n",
            "[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  be on using Django to build an API for our online store. Client\n",
            "[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  applications can use this API to get or save the data. How\n",
            "[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  these clients are built is irrelevant here. We can use react, angular, or\n",
            "[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  even plain JavaScript. That falls under frontend development which has nothing to do\n",

            "[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  you can see that pipenv has created a virtual environment for this\n",

            "[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  Now take a look, so here's our virtual environment,\n",
            "[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  in this environment we have this bin folder that contains\n",
            "[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  a bunch of binaries, for example we have python, pip, Django\n",
            "[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  admin and so on. So back to the terminal, pipenv\n",
            "[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  created a virtual environment and installed Django inside that environment.\n",
            "[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  But in addition to this, pipenv also created two files\n",

            "[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  So I'm going to open this directory using visual studio code by running\n",

            "[14:18.000 --> 14:22.000]  this folder onto vs code. Alright,\n",
            "[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  so here's our pipfile, this is like package.json for JavaScript\n",
            "[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  projects. So in this file we can see that our project needs\n",
            "[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  this particular version of python, and under packages\n",
            "[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  you can see the packages that our application is dependent upon.\n",
            "[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  So here we have Django equals asterisk, that means any version\n",
            "[14:42.000 --> 14:46.000]  or the latest version of Django. If we installed a particular version\n",
            "[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  of Django, we would see that version here. Now back to the terminal\n",
            "[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  window, we need to activate this virtual environment, so we'll use the\n",
            "[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  python interpreter inside this virtual environment, not the one that is\n",
            "[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  installed globally on this machine. To do that we're going to run pipenv\n",
            "[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  shell. Okay, next\n",
            "[15:06.000 --> 15:10.000]  we're going to use Django admin to start a new project. Django\n",
            "[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  admin is a utility that comes with Django. So if you run it,\n",
            "[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  we can see all these commands that we can use to work with Django\n",
            "[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  projects. As we go through the course, you'll become familiar with these commands.\n",
            "[15:22.000 --> 15:26.000]  In this lesson we're going to use Django admin, start\n",
            "[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  project, and we're going to call that project store front.\n",
            "[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  Now back to vs code, Django\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  admin created this directory for our project, and inside this directory\n",
            "[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  it created another directory that is the core of our application.\n",
            "[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  In this directory we have these files which I'm going to talk about in a second, but before\n",
            "[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  I do so, let's get rid of this redundancy. Because we have three\n",
            "[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  store front directories. The top one is the one that we created\n",
            "[15:54.000 --> 15:58.000]  earlier in the terminal, and then we have these two other directories\n",
            "[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  one for the project, one for the core of our application. So\n",
            "[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  I'm going to delete this project directory,\n",
            "[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  now we're back in the previous step. So we don't have a Django project at this stage.\n",
            "[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  Now, back in the terminal, let's bring up the last command\n",
            "[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  but type a period at the end. This tells Django to use\n",
            "[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  the current directory as the project directory. So Django is not going to\n",
            "[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  create an additional directory for our project.\n",
            "[16:26.000 --> 16:30.000]  Now take a look. So, we have this directory\n",
            "[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  which is the core of our application. In this directory we have this init file\n",
            "[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  which defines this directory as a package, we have this settings module\n",
            "[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  where we define our application settings, we have the URLs module\n",
            "[16:42.000 --> 16:46.000]  where we define the URLs of our application, and these two other modules\n",
            "[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  that are used for deployment. For now, don't worry about them.\n",
            "[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  Now, next to this directory we have is file manage.py.\n",
            "[16:54.000 --> 16:58.000]  This is a wrapper around Django admin, so going forward\n",
            "[16:58.000 --> 17:02.000]  instead of Django admin we're going to use manage.py. The reason for this\n",
            "[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  is that manage.py takes the settings of this project into account.\n",
            "[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  Let me show you what I mean. So, now that we have a project\n",
            "[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  we want to run a web server. So, another command that Django admin\n",
            "[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  provides is run server.\n",
            "[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  However, if you're on Django admin, run server\n",
            "[17:22.000 --> 17:26.000]  we get an error saying request setting\n",
            "[17:26.000 --> 17:30.000]  debug, but settings are not configured because at this point\n",
            "[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  Django admin doesn't know about the settings of our project. So,\n",
            "[17:34.000 --> 17:38.000]  now that we have a project, instead of Django admin we're going to run\n",
            "[17:38.000 --> 17:42.000]  python manage.py, now look\n",
            "[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  we see the same commands that Django admin provides.\n",
            "[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  So, here we can say python manage.py\n",
            "[17:50.000 --> 17:54.000]  run server. Now, optionally we can supply a port\n",
            "[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  number, if we don't supply this, by default this will use port\n",
            "[17:58.000 --> 18:02.000]  8000. But you might have another application running on port 8000,\n",
            "[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  in that case you might want to explicitly set the port number. So,\n",
            "[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  let's go ahead with that, now we don't get an error, because manage.py\n",
            "[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  knows about the settings of our project. Now,\n",
            "[18:14.000 --> 18:18.000]  here we get this warning saying you have 18 unapplied migrations.\n",
            "[18:18.000 --> 18:22.000]  Don't worry about this yet, we'll talk about this soon. So, if you look\n",
            "[18:22.000 --> 18:26.000]  over here, you can see that Django has started a development server\n",
            "[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  at this address. So we can copy this and paste it into browser,\n",
            "[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  or if you're on a Mac and using z shell, you can hold down the command key\n",
            "[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  and click this. Alright, beautiful,\n",
            "[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  our first Django project is running successfully, so let's move on to the next lesson.\n",
            "[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  So far I've been using a separate terminal window, but vs code also has\n",
            "[18:54.000 --> 18:58.000]  an integrated terminal window that is easier to use, but to use that\n",
            "[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  we have to properly configure it to use the python interpreter inside\n",
            "[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  our virtual environment. Let me show you how to do this. So,\n",
            "[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  back to our terminal window, first we're going to stop the web server by pressing\n",
            "[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  ctrl and c. Now, back in vs code,\n",
            "[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  on the top, under the view menu, look,\n",
            "[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  we have this command palette, the shortcut on Mac is shift, command\n",
            "[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  and p. Now here we're going to search for python\n",
            "[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  interpreter. So, currently,\n",
            "[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  vs code is using this python interpreter that is installed globally on this\n",
            "[19:34.000 --> 19:38.000]  machine, we don't want to use this, we want to use the one inside our virtual environment.\n",
            "[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  But how can we find the path to our virtual environment? Very easy.\n",
            "[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  So, back to the terminal, let's run pip n\n",
            "[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  dash dash vn. Alright, here's the path\n",
            "[19:50.000 --> 19:54.000]  so let's copy this, good,\n",
            "[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  now back to vs code, we're going to select\n",
            "[19:58.000 --> 20:02.000]  interpreter path, then we're going to paste the path, and append\n",
            "[20:02.000 --> 20:06.000]  slash bin slash python\n",
            "[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  at the end. If you're on windows, instead of a forward slash, you have to\n",
            "[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  use a backslash. Good, now\n",
            "[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  in this project we have an extra directory vs code,\n",
            "[20:18.000 --> 20:22.000]  we have a settings file, and here we have the path to\n",
            "[20:22.000 --> 20:26.000]  python interpreter. Good. With this, we can go to the view menu,\n",
            "[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  now look, we have this integrated terminal,\n",
            "[20:30.000 --> 20:34.000]  the shortcut on Mac is control and backtick,\n",
            "[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  now vs code automatically activates the virtual environment\n",
            "[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  for this project. So, here we can run python\n",
            "[20:42.000 --> 20:46.000]  manage.py, run server. Good, so going\n",

            "[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  Now one quick tip, sometimes when running this command, you might get a\n",

            "[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  ultimate Django course. The complete course is about 10 hours and\n",
            "[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  goes way beyond this tutorial. So if you're serious about learning Django\n",
            "[21:42.000 --> 21:46.000]  and are looking for a job as a backend developer, I highly encourage you to\n",
            "[21:46.000 --> 21:50.000]  enroll in the course. The course comes with tons of exercises and solutions,\n",
            "[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  a full e-commerce project that you will eventually deploy to the cloud, plus\n",

            "[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  that's totally fine, let's move on to the next lesson.\n",
            "[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  Alright,\n",
            "[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  let's talk about apps. So every Django project is essentially\n",
            "[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  a collection of various apps, each providing certain functionality.\n",
            "[22:18.000 --> 22:22.000]  Just like the apps on your mobile phone, each app provides a certain\n",
            "[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  functionality, right? Django projects are exactly the same. So\n",
            "[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  in this project, let's open up the store front directory, and then\n",
            "[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  look at our settings module. Now we can collapse this panel by pressing command\n",
            "[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  and B on Mac, or control and B on Windows. Okay, now\n",
            "[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  in this module, we have a bunch of different settings, in this lesson\n",
            "[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  we're going to look at the install apps. So every Django project\n",
            "[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  by default includes these apps. The first app is the\n",
            "[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  admin app, which gives us an admin interface for managing our data.\n",
            "[22:54.000 --> 22:58.000]  Then we have the auth app, which is used for authenticating\n",
            "[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  users, then we have content types app, which we'll talk about later in the course.\n",
            "[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  Next we have the sessions app, which is kind of legacy, we don't use sessions anymore.\n",
            "[23:06.000 --> 23:10.000]  A session is a temporary memory on the server for managing\n",
            "[23:10.000 --> 23:14.000]  users data. These days when building APIs with Django, we don't use\n",
            "[23:14.000 --> 23:18.000]  the sessions app. So we can come here and delete this app.\n",
            "[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  Then we have the messages app, which is used for displaying one time\n",
            "[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  notifications to the user, and finally we have the static files app\n",
            "[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  for serving static files, like images, CSS files and so on.\n",
            "[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  So each app provides a certain piece of functionality.\n",
            "[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  Now we can also create our own apps here. So let's save this file.\n",
            "[23:38.000 --> 23:42.000]  Now let's open up the terminal window by pressing control and back\n",
            "[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  tick. So here's our terminal window where we have our development\n",
            "[23:46.000 --> 23:50.000]  server running. We're going to open a new terminal window.\n",
            "[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  Okay, now let's expand this. To clear the window\n",
            "[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  we simply press control and L. Now we're going to run Python\n",
            "[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  manage.py, start app, and we're going to call this app\n",
            "[24:02.000 --> 24:06.000]  playground. Okay, so let's close\n",
            "[24:06.000 --> 24:10.000]  this window and open up the explorer panel. Alright,\n",
            "[24:10.000 --> 24:14.000]  look, here's our new app which is represented using a folder with a\n",
            "[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  special structure. So every Django app has the exact same structure.\n",
            "[24:18.000 --> 24:22.000]  Here we have the migrations folder for generating database tables,\n",
            "[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  we'll talk about that later in the course. We have a complete section about this topic.\n",
            "[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  We have the admin module where we define how the admin interface\n",
            "[24:30.000 --> 24:34.000]  for this app is going to look like. Next we have the apps module where\n",
            "[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  we configure this app. So the name is misleading. I don't know why Django\n",
            "[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  developers decided to call this module apps. It would be better if it was called\n",
            "[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  config. That's just my two cents. Next we have the models module where we define\n",
            "[24:46.000 --> 24:50.000]  the model classes for this app. We use model classes to pull out\n",
            "[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  data from the database and present to the user. Next we have the tests\n",
            "[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  module where we write our unit tests. And finally we have the views\n",
            "[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  module which we'll talk about in the next lesson. Again the name is misleading, this is\n",
            "[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  not the view that you think if you come from a frontend development background. So\n",
            "[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  what we have here is essentially a request handler. It's not a view, it doesn't have\n",
            "[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  a template or HTML. Again we'll talk about that in the next lesson.\n",
            "[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  So we created a new app, now we need to register this app in the\n",
            "[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  settings module. So, every time you create a new app,\n",
            "[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  you need to register it here in the list of installed apps. We simply\n",
            "[25:26.000 --> 25:30.000]  add the name of the app which is called playground.\n",
            "[25:30.000 --> 25:34.000]  Save the changes, done. In the next lesson we're going to talk about views.\n",
            "[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  Alright, let's talk about views. So\n",
            "[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  earlier you learned that HTTP is a request response protocol.\n",
            "[25:46.000 --> 25:50.000]  So every data exchange involves a request and a response. This is\n",
            "[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  where we use views in Django. So here in the playground folder,\n",
            "[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  let's open up the views module. This is where we define our\n",
            "[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  views or view functions. A view function is a function that\n",
            "[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  takes a request and returns a response. So more\n",
            "[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  accurately, it's a request handler. In some frameworks\n",
            "[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  it's called an action. In Django it's called a view. But I don't\n",
            "[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  agree with this name because from an architectural point of view, a view is often\n",
            "[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  associated with something that the user sees. That part in Django is called\n",
            "[26:22.000 --> 26:26.000]  a template and we'll talk about that later in this section. Now that aside, let's\n",
            "[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  create our first view function. So we're going to create a function\n",
            "[26:30.000 --> 26:34.000]  we can call it anything we want. I'm going to call it say\n",
            "[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  hello. Now this function should take a request object and\n",
            "[26:38.000 --> 26:42.000]  return a response. So first, on the top\n",
            "[26:42.000 --> 26:46.000]  from Django, that HTTP package, we're going to import\n",
            "[26:46.000 --> 26:50.000]  the HTTP response class. Now in this function we can\n",
            "[26:50.000 --> 26:54.000]  do anything we want. In a real world scenario we can pull data from a database\n",
            "[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  we can transform data, we can send emails and so on.\n",
            "[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  For now, let's just return a simple response. So we're\n",
            "[27:02.000 --> 27:06.000]  going to return an instance of the HTTP response\n",
            "[27:06.000 --> 27:10.000]  class, and in this object, in this response, you want to\n",
            "[27:10.000 --> 27:14.000]  add a simple string. So let's say hello world.\n",
            "[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  So this is our first view or first view function, now we need to\n",
            "[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  map this view to a URL, so when we get a request at that URL\n",
            "[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  this function will be called. And that's what we're going to do next.\n",
            "[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  Alright here's our Django project, now let's say\n",
            "[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  whenever we send a request to playground slash hello,\n",
            "[27:38.000 --> 27:42.000]  our view function should be called and return hello world to the user. Let's see\n",
            "[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  how we can do that. So back to our project, here in the playground folder\n",
            "[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  we're going to add a new file called URLs.py\n",
            "[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  you could call it anything, the name doesn't matter, but by convention we call it\n",
            "[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  URLs. Now in this module we're going to map our\n",
            "[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  URLs to our view functions. So on the top we're going to import\n",
            "[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  the path function from Django.URLs. So from\n",
            "[28:06.000 --> 28:10.000]  Django.URLs we're going to import the path function. Now don't worry about\n",
            "[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  memorizing any of these, as you practice all of this will become second nature.\n",
            "[28:14.000 --> 28:18.000]  Also, from the current folder we should import the\n",
            "[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  views module so we can reference our view function. Now we should define\n",
            "[28:22.000 --> 28:26.000]  a special variable called URL patterns. All in\n",
            "[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  lower case, make sure to spell it properly, because this is what Django looks for.\n",
            "[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  We should set this to an array of URL pattern\n",
            "[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  objects. We use the path function to create a URL pattern\n",
            "[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  object. So if we call this function, look at the signature of this function,\n",
            "[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  this function has a bunch of parameters, the first one is route, which is\n",
            "[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  a string, the notation you see here is called type annotation, which is kind of\n",
            "[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  a new feature in Python, with type annotation we can see the type of parameters\n",
            "[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  and the return value of a function. So the first parameter is route\n",
            "[28:58.000 --> 29:02.000]  which is a string, the second parameter is view, which is a function\n",
            "[29:02.000 --> 29:06.000]  that returns HTTP response object. Now look over here,\n",
            "[29:06.000 --> 29:10.000]  this notation represents the return type of this function.\n",
            "[29:10.000 --> 29:14.000]  So the path function returns a URL pattern object.\n",
            "[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  So I'm going to call this function and give it two arguments. A route or\n",
            "[29:18.000 --> 29:22.000]  a URL, which is playground slash hello, and\n",
            "[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  a view function. So from the views module we're going to get\n",
            "[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  say hello. Note that I'm not calling this function so here\n",
            "[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  we don't have a pair of parenthesis, we're just passing a reference to this function.\n",
            "[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  Okay, so what we have here is called\n",
            "[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  a URL conf module, that basically means URL configuration.\n",
            "[29:42.000 --> 29:46.000]  So every app can have its own URL configuration. But\n",
            "[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  now we need to import this URL configuration into the main URL configuration\n",
            "[29:50.000 --> 29:54.000]  for this project. Where is it? You saw it earlier.\n",
            "[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  So, back to the explorer panel, here in the store front folder,\n",
            "[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  we have another URLs module.\n",
            "[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  Up here we have a bunch of comments about how we should use this module,\n",
            "[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  now look over here. If you want to include another URL conf\n",
            "[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  there are two things we need to do. First we need to import the include function\n",
            "[30:14.000 --> 30:18.000]  from Django.URLs, so over here we have from Django.URLs\n",
            "[30:18.000 --> 30:22.000]  we're going to import the include function.\n",
            "[30:22.000 --> 30:26.000]  Next we need to add a URL to URL patterns.\n",
            "[30:26.000 --> 30:30.000]  So in this module, we also have a URL patterns object\n",
            "[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  which is an array of URL patterns object. So here we're going to call\n",
            "[30:34.000 --> 30:38.000]  paths, give it a route, and then we use\n",
            "[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  the include function to reference the URL configuration module\n",
            "[30:42.000 --> 30:46.000]  in this app. So\n",
            "[30:46.000 --> 30:50.000]  we're going to call paths and say any URLs\n",
            "[30:50.000 --> 30:54.000]  that start with playground, followed by a forward slash\n",
            "[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  should be routed to our playground app. So this is where we use\n",
            "[30:58.000 --> 31:02.000]  the include function. Now, the include function requires a parameter\n",
            "[31:02.000 --> 31:06.000]  that is a string, here we're going to reference playground.\n",

            "[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  add a middleware. We use middleware to hook into Django's request\n",
            "[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  response processing. So in our settings module we have a setting\n",
            "[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  for middleware, we're going to add this line\n",

            "[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  document, of course the head element is missing but it doesn't really matter.\n",
            "[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  Now back to the browser, refresh, and here's Django debug toolbar.\n",
            "[47:54.000 --> 47:58.000]  Here we have different panels like history, we're seeing the URLs we have hit\n",
            "[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  so far, we have versions, to see the version of Django, Python\n",
            "[48:02.000 --> 48:06.000]  and debug toolbar we're running, we have processing time, we have\n",
            "[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  our settings, we have request headers and so on. Now my personal\n",
            "[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  favorite panel is the SQL or SQL panel.\n",
            "[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  Here we can see the queries that are sent to the database, so later in the course\n",
            "[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  where we talk about querying the database using Django's object relational\n",
            "[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  mapper, we're going to come back to this panel and see what queries Django\n",
            "[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  will generate and send to the database. So that's it for this lesson,\n",
            "[48:30.000 --> 48:34.000]  we're done with this section, in the next section we're going to talk about building\n",
            "[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  a data model. So I'll see you in the next section.\n",
            "[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  Welcome back to another section of the ultimate\n",
            "[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  Django course. In this section, we're going to talk about models\n",
            "[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  which are used to store and retrieve data. We'll start off by a quick\n",
            "[48:50.000 --> 48:54.000]  introduction to data modeling to make sure you know the essential concepts, then\n",
            "[48:54.000 --> 48:58.000]  we're going to design the data model for an ecommerce application, next we're going to\n",
            "[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  talk about organizing our models in apps to improve reusability,\n",
            "[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  this is one of the areas that is often misunderstood so I'm going to demystify\n",
            "[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  it once and for all. And then we'll spend the rest of this section in coding model\n",
            "[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  classes. We'll use these classes to store and retrieve data throughout\n",
            "[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  the course. So let's jump in and get started.\n",
            "[49:22.000 --> 49:26.000]  The first step in every Django project\n",
            "[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  is figuring out the pieces of data we want to store. So\n",
            "[49:30.000 --> 49:34.000]  what entities or concepts do we have in an ecommerce application?\n",
            "[49:34.000 --> 49:38.000]  Well, for starters we need the concept of a product with attributes like\n",
            "[49:38.000 --> 49:42.000]  title, description, price, and inventory. Now in a real\n",
            "[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  scenario, a product entity might have other attributes, it really depends\n",
            "[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  on the requirements of our application. For now, we just want to keep things simple.\n",
            "[49:50.000 --> 49:54.000]  Now, quite often our products are divided in different categories\n",
            "[49:54.000 --> 49:58.000]  like shoes, beauty products, fruits, and so on. So we need\n",
            "[49:58.000 --> 50:02.000]  another entity called collection or category with an attribute called\n",
            "[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  title. Now we need to add a relationship or an association\n",
            "[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  between these entities so we can start from one end and navigate to the other end.\n",
            "[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  For example, we can get a collection and find all the products in that\n",
            "[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  collection. Now let's assume that in our application, a\n",
            "[50:18.000 --> 50:22.000]  product can belong to one and only one collection, and a collection\n",
            "[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  can have multiple products. So an asterisk represents\n",
            "[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  many. We could also use an n here. Now we have a one to\n",
            "[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  many relationship between collection and product. So, relationships\n",
            "[50:34.000 --> 50:38.000]  can be one to one, one to many, and many to many. Back to our\n",
            "[50:38.000 --> 50:42.000]  diagram. Now over here we can add a label called products, and that means\n",
            "[50:42.000 --> 50:46.000]  when we code these entities or these classes in the collection class\n",
            "[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  we're going to have an attribute called products. For now, I just want to hide this\n",
            "[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  for simplicity. Now, sometimes we can have multiple relationships\n",
            "[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  or multiple associations between two entities. So let's\n",
            "[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  imagine that a collection can optionally have a featured product.\n",
            "[51:02.000 --> 51:06.000]  That is the product whose picture we want to show to the user.\n",
            "[51:06.000 --> 51:10.000]  So we can add a second relationship between these entities. Now look at this number here.\n",
            "[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  0 to 1 means a collection can have 0 to\n",
            "[51:14.000 --> 51:18.000]  1 product and we're going to call that attribute featured product.\n",
            "[51:18.000 --> 51:22.000]  So once again, that means in the collection class we're going to have an attribute\n",
            "[51:22.000 --> 51:26.000]  called featured product. Now you might ask, what about the\n",
            "[51:26.000 --> 51:30.000]  id attribute? Shouldn't every entity have an id attribute? Yes.\n",
            "[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  But Django is going to automatically create that for us, that's why I haven't shown it here.\n",
            "[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  Now a little exercise for you. Grab a piece of paper\n",
            "[51:38.000 --> 51:42.000]  and identify the other essential entities we need in an e-commerce\n",
            "[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  application. Just the bare minimum. Don't go ahead and create a complex\n",
            "[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  diagram like this, I don't want this. There are only 5 entities that I want you\n",
            "[51:50.000 --> 51:54.000]  to identify. So spend a couple minutes and identify these entities\n",
            "[51:54.000 --> 51:58.000]  along with the attributes and relationships. Then come back and see my solution.\n",
            "[51:58.000 --> 52:08.000]  Alright, so this is what we ended up with in the previous lesson.\n",
            "[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  We have a one to many relationship between collections and products.\n",
            "[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  Now don't take this as a hard and fast rule. Maybe in your\n",
            "[52:16.000 --> 52:20.000]  application, a product can belong to many collections. Then you're going to have\n",
            "[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  a many to many relationship between products and collections.\n",
            "[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  So, back to our model. I'm going to remove the collection from here, so\n",
            "[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  we have some free space on the screen. Now, what else do we need here?\n",
            "[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  Well, in every e-commerce application, we have the concept of a shopping\n",
            "[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  cart, right? So we're going to have an entity or a model or class called\n",
            "[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  cart with an attribute called created at. Let's assume\n",
            "[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  that we need to know when each cart is created, so every now and then we can\n",
            "[52:48.000 --> 52:52.000]  do a clean up and remove carts that are 30 days old. I just\n",
            "[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  made this up. But in a real scenario, you should always design your models\n",
            "[52:56.000 --> 53:00.000]  based on the requirements of your project. Don't make up your own rules.\n",
            "[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  Now, we need a relationship or an association between products\n",
            "[53:04.000 --> 53:08.000]  and carts. Because a cart can have multiple products, and a product might be\n",
            "[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  in different carts. So here we have a many to many relationship between\n",
            "[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  products and carts. Now, sometimes the relationship between two entities\n",
            "[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  can have attributes. For example, if a product is in a shopping cart,\n",
            "[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  we need to know how many instances of that product we have in the shopping cart.\n",
            "[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  So this relationship itself should have an attribute called\n",
            "[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  quantity. So we're going to add a new entity here called cart item.\n",
            "[53:32.000 --> 53:36.000]  Now look at the notation I've used to represent this concept. I've\n",
            "[53:36.000 --> 53:40.000]  connected cart item to the relationship using a dashed line. That means\n",
            "[53:40.000 --> 53:44.000]  cart item represents the relationship between these two entities.\n",
            "[53:44.000 --> 53:48.000]  Product and cart. This is what we call an association class.\n",
            "[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  So cart item is an association class.\n",
            "[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  Now there's another way to show this. Instead of using an association class,\n",
            "[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  we can add a relationship between cart and cart item, because a cart\n",
            "[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  might contain multiple items, and an item belongs to one\n",
            "[54:04.000 --> 54:08.000]  and only one cart. Similarly we can add a relationship\n",
            "[54:08.000 --> 54:12.000]  between product and cart item, because each cart item represents\n",
            "[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  a single product, and a product might be referenced by many\n",
            "[54:16.000 --> 54:20.000]  cart items. So here we have two one to many relationships\n",
            "[54:20.000 --> 54:24.000]  between these entities. Now compare this with the association class\n",
            "[54:24.000 --> 54:28.000]  notation. So we can either add a many to many relationship\n",
            "[54:28.000 --> 54:32.000]  with an association class, or two one to many relationships.\n",
            "[54:32.000 --> 54:36.000]  It's a matter of personal preference. So we're done with the shopping\n",
            "[54:36.000 --> 54:40.000]  cart, but you might ask, what about the user or the customer that owns\n",
            "[54:40.000 --> 54:44.000]  this cart? Where is that in the diagram? Well I haven't connected cart with\n",
            "[54:44.000 --> 54:48.000]  an entity like customer, because we don't want to force people to register and\n",
            "[54:48.000 --> 54:52.000]  log in before they can add products to their shopping cart, okay? So there is\n",
            "[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  no relationship between carts and customers. So carts are essentially\n",
            "[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  anonymous. Anyone can have a cart, whether they're anonymous users or\n",
            "[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  registered customers. So, we're done with the cart,\n",
            "[55:04.000 --> 55:08.000]  now let's talk about customers. So our customer entity can have attributes\n",
            "[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  like name, email, username, password, and so on. Now for\n",
            "[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  simplicity, I'm only showing name and email here. Now a customer\n",
            "[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  can have many orders, and each order belongs to one\n",
            "[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  and only one customer. So we need a one to many relationship between\n",
            "[55:24.000 --> 55:28.000]  customers and orders. Now once again, the order entity might have multiple\n",
            "[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  attributes, for now we just want to know when this order was placed.\n",
            "[55:32.000 --> 55:36.000]  Now an order can contain multiple products, and a product\n",
            "[55:36.000 --> 55:40.000]  can be in multiple orders. So we have a many to many relationship between orders\n",
            "[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  and products. And similar to the shopping cart example, this relationship\n",
            "[55:44.000 --> 55:48.000]  itself needs attributes. So here we need another entity called order item\n",
            "[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  with an attribute called quantity. That's our association class.\n",
            "[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  Alternatively, you could add a relationship between order and order\n",
            "[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  item, because each order may contain multiple items, and\n",
            "[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  each order item belongs to one and only one order.\n",
            "[56:04.000 --> 56:08.000]  Similarly, an order item references one and only one product,\n",
            "[56:08.000 --> 56:12.000]  while a given product might be referenced by multiple order items.\n",
            "[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  So two, one to many relationships. So these are the entities\n",
            "[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  that I wanted you to identify. But to make this project more interesting, I\n",
            "[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  decided to throw in one more entity, tag. Here we have a many to many\n",
            "[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  relationship between products and tags, because a product can have many\n",
            "[56:28.000 --> 56:32.000]  tags, and a tag might be referenced by different products. We'll come back to this\n",
            "[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  entity in the next lesson.\n",
            "[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  So I told you\n",
            "[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  that a Django project contains one or more apps, and just like the apps on your\n",
            "[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  phone, each app in a Django project provides a specific piece of\n",
            "[56:50.000 --> 56:54.000]  functionality. So that means each app is going to have its own\n",
            "[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  data model. So in this lesson, we're going to look at a few different ways to organize\n",
            "[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  our entities in different apps. One way is to have a single app called\n",
            "[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  the store, and drop all of our entities here. Now, we can bundle and\n",
            "[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  distribute this app via pip, and this way anyone can install this app\n",
            "[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  in their project and get all these models and the functionality around them.\n",
            "[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  So next time we're working on an ecommerce project, we don't have to rewrite the same\n",
            "[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  functionality over and over. We simply install this app in our project,\n",
            "[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  and write extra code for customization. Great. But there's a problem\n",
            "[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  here. As this application grows and gets more complex,\n",
            "[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  it gets bloated with too many things. Like too many models, too many\n",
            "[57:34.000 --> 57:38.000]  views and other stuff. This is what we call a monolith, like a large\n",
            "[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  heavy piece of stone. So at some point our application might become\n",
            "[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  hard to understand, hard to maintain, and hard to reuse. It becomes like one of\n",
            "[57:46.000 --> 57:50.000]  those remote controls with too many buttons. When designing these apps, we want\n",
            "[57:50.000 --> 57:54.000]  to follow the Unix philosophy. So each app should do one thing\n",
            "[57:54.000 --> 57:58.000]  and do it well. So here's another solution. We can break down\n",
            "[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  this project into four small apps. The products app, which represents\n",
            "[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  a product catalog. So here we're going to have three entities, product,\n",
            "[58:06.000 --> 58:10.000]  collection, and tag. Then we're going to have the customers app for\n",
            "[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  managing customers, we're going to have the shopping cart app for adding\n",
            "[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  the shopping cart functionality, and the orders app for adding the ordering\n",
            "[58:18.000 --> 58:22.000]  functionality. Not bad, right? Well, this is actually a poor\n",
            "[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  way of breaking down this project for a number of reasons. Look at the coupling\n",
            "[58:26.000 --> 58:30.000]  or dependency between these apps. The orders app is dependent on the\n",
            "[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  shopping cart app, which is dependent on the products app. So next time\n",
            "[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  we're working on an ecommerce project, we'll have to install all these apps one\n",
            "[58:38.000 --> 58:42.000]  by one. First we have to install the products app, followed by the shopping\n",
            "[58:42.000 --> 58:46.000]  cart app, the customers app, and the orders app. Ideally each app\n",
            "[58:46.000 --> 58:50.000]  should be self contained so we can easily drop it into a new project.\n",
            "[58:50.000 --> 58:54.000]  The other problem is that if we publish a new version of the products app,\n",
            "[58:54.000 --> 58:58.000]  that might cause a break and change in the shopping cart and subsequently\n",
            "[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  orders apps. So anyone using these apps have to upgrade all these apps\n",
            "[59:02.000 --> 59:06.000]  together. Again, more and more work. Also, it doesn't really make\n",
            "[59:06.000 --> 59:10.000]  sense to have the shopping cart functionality without having a product catalog.\n",
            "[59:10.000 --> 59:14.000]  Right? Why would we ever want to add the shopping cart functionality to a project\n",
            "[59:14.000 --> 59:18.000]  without a product catalog. So shopping cart functionality\n",
            "[59:18.000 --> 59:22.000]  and product catalog always go together. By the same token,\n",
            "[59:22.000 --> 59:26.000]  why would we ever want to add the shopping cart functionality to a project without\n",
            "[59:26.000 --> 59:30.000]  the ability to place an order? Just to allow people to add something to their\n",
            "[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  shopping cart? Then what? Again, it doesn't really make sense.\n",
            "[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  So these concepts are highly related and should be bundled together.\n",
            "[59:38.000 --> 59:42.000]  If we separate them, we increase coupling between apps and we end up with the\n",
            "[59:42.000 --> 59:46.000]  problems I just talked about. So does it mean we have to go back to the monolithic\n",
            "[59:46.000 --> 59:50.000]  design? No. There is a middle ground here. Look at the tag entity.\n",
            "[59:50.000 --> 59:54.000]  The ability to tag products is optional. We don't necessarily need it\n",
            "[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  in every ecommerce application. In fact, we might need it in other\n",
            "[59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  types of applications like a blog or video platform and so on.\n",
            "[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  So tagging is not specific to products or an ecommerce application.\n",
            "[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  It's a separate piece of functionality. So I'm going to move\n",
            "[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000]  the tag entity to a separate app called tags. And here we're going to have\n",
            "[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  another entity called tagged item which represents an item\n",
            "[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  that is tagged. It can be a product, an article, a video and so on.\n",
            "[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  It's an abstract concept. Now with this separation, each\n",
            "[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000]  app is self contained and provides a specific piece of functionality.\n",
            "[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  So we can use either or both of them in a new project depending on\n",
            "[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  what we're going to build. Plus we have zero coupling between these apps,\n",
            "[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  so we can independently change and deploy them without affecting other\n",
            "[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  apps. This is the proper way to break down this project into multiple\n",
            "[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  apps. So here's the take away. If our app boundary is so\n",
            "[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  large, we'll end up with a monolith that gets bloated and becomes hard to\n",
            "[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  reuse. On the other hand, if our app boundaries are so small and\n",
            "[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  fine grained, we'll end up with a lot of coupling between them. A good\n",
            "[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  design is one with minimal coupling and high cohesion meaning high\n",
            "[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000]  focus. So each app is focused on a specific piece of functionality and\n",
            "[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000]  includes everything needed to fulfill that piece of functionality.\n",
            "[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]  So back to vs code, we're going to create two new apps.\n",
            "[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]  So we run python manage.py start\n",
            "[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  app, the first app is store, and the\n",
            "[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  second one is tags. Okay, now\n",
            "[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  as I told you before, every time we create a new app, we should add it in the list\n",
            "[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  of installed apps. So let's close this window and\n",
            "[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  go to our settings module, here's the list of installed apps,\n",
            "[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  I'm going to add those apps right here. So store and\n",
            "[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  tags. Alright, we're done with this step, starting from\n",
            "[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  the next lesson, we're going to create the model classes for these apps.\n",
