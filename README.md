# Intelligent-Micro-Learning-Platform

This project provides student an edge over the pre-existing method of learning. Here the course videos watched by student are tracked and for assessment a quiz is prepared out of the videos watched by the student and further course recommendations are provided based on course completed. The quiz is generated from the transcripts generated from the videos.
